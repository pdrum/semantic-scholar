Yet these systems, in their conventional forms, are restricted to active interaction from the users. In scenarios where users are not cooperating with the system, these systems are challenged. Failure in cooperation with the biometric systems might be intentional or because the users are incapable of handling the interaction procedure with the biometric system or simply forget to cooperate with it, due to for example, illness like dementia. This work introduces a challenging bimodal database, including face and hand information of the users when they approach a door to open it by its handle in a noncooperative context. We have defined two (an easy and a challenging) protocols on how to use the database. We have reported results on many baseline methods, including deep learning techniques as well as conventional methods on the database. The obtained results show the merit of the proposed database and the challenging nature of access control with non-cooperative users.", "references": ["A-survey-on-techniques-to-handle-face-recognition-Lahasan-Lutfi/919d08e9645404c60b88f5f5e8511e363ccdf922", "Door-Knob-Hand-Recognition-System-Qu-Zhang/f688f297a52af4f6b44be934a112f4c2296c35f5", "Fingerprint-Recognition-of-Young-Children-Jain-Arora/250a80e0fb57835391b8cc7452f84dfbab70a753", "Long-range-iris-recognition%3A-A-survey-Nguyen-Fookes/6462ef39ca88f538405616239471a8ea17d76259", "On-the-Usability-of-Electroencephalographic-Signals-Yang-Deravi/10d80190b8bebf9364f2417bdaaac4f56730b183", "Face-Recognition-in-Challenging-Environments%3A-An-G%C3%BCnther-Shafey/6fa3857faba887ed048a9e355b3b8642c6aab1d8", "Fusion-of-face-recognition-methods-at-score-level-Cherifi-Cherfaoui/b48a9d018fc4fdb2ddf33e79dc5ee1a3bf0aa91a", "Adaptive-facial-point-detection-and-emotion-for-a-Zhang-Mistry/234c106036964131c0f2daf76c47ced802652046"]},

One way to reduce the number of data misses or their effect is data prefetching. As data accesses have high temporal correlations, temporal prefetching techniques are promising for them. While state-of-the-art temporal prefetching techniques are effective at reducing the number of data misses, we observe that there is a significant gap between what they offer and the opportunity. This work aims to improve the effectiveness of temporal prefetching techniques. We identify the lookup mechanism of existing temporal prefetchers responsible for the large gap between what they offer and the opportunity. Existing lookup mechanisms either not choose the right stream in the history, or unnecessarily delay the stream selection, and hence, miss the opportunity at the beginning of every stream. In this work, we introduce Domino prefetching to address the limitations of existing temporal prefetchers. Domino prefetcher is a temporal data prefetching technique that logically looks up the history with both one and two last miss addresses to find a match for prefetching. We propose a practical design for Domino prefetcher that employs an Enhanced Index Table that is indexed by just a single miss address. We show that Domino prefetcher captures more than 90% of the temporal opportunity. Through detailed evaluation targeting a quad-core processor and a set of server workloads, we show that Domino prefetcher improves system performance by 16% over the baseline with no data prefetcher and 6% over the state-of- the-art temporal data prefetcher.", "references": ["Identifying-Hierarchical-Structure-in-Sequences%3A-A-Nevill-Manning-Witten/02aca8223525caa99efc4b0e2810e450ee6776ba", "Clearing-the-clouds%3A-a-study-of-emerging-scale-out-Ferdman-Adileh/8b10b13fb495101d1e4eb768907cff05e3bd9315", "Practical-off-chip-meta-data-for-temporal-memory-Wenisch-Ferdman/2b51020e54a6361316cc477c39a2759902022580", "Temporal-memory-streaming-Wenisch/adc43c28e86d5f577e3b4b2ff120162a7225b1f0", "Data-cache-prefetching-using-a-global-history-Nesbit-Smith/3933d3380710680865441c87a22d691ba751a2ef", "Performance-of-Database-Workloads-on-Shared-Memory-Ranganathan-Gharachorloo/04dba1bd51e8f3348c57cb7b5148abd9f4b5aa21", "Linearizing-irregular-memory-accesses-for-improved-Jain-Lin/2aed1e5dab68713bf8ed0fb4b35a0ec67b087c30", "Spatio-temporal-memory-streaming-Somogyi-Wenisch/048336a0dc1029416ce47c78b9a5cba8422e6efd", "Temporal-streams-in-commercial-server-applications-Wenisch-Ferdman/293e7c79a37798032b3047324d101bc49d9a37a2", "Dynamic-Hot-Data-Stream-Prefetching-for-Programs-Chilimbi-Hirzel/60b85b7ee655397a4d2202f9cdf6dd5e3f04f6fd"]},

In this paper, we target Track-based Traffic Control Systems (TTCSs) in which the traffic flows through pre-specified sub-tracks and is coordinated by a traffic controller. We introduce a coordinated actor model to design self-adaptive TTCSs and provide a general mapping between various TTCSs and the coordinated actor model. The coordinated actor model is extended to build large-scale self-adaptive TTCSs in a decentralized setting. We also discuss the benefits of using Ptolemy II as a framework for model-based development of large-scale self-adaptive systems that supports designing multiple hierarchical MAPE-K feedback loops interacting with each other. We propose a template based on the coordinated actor model to design a self-adaptive TTCS in Ptolemy II that can be instantiated for various TTCSs. We enhance the proposed template with a predictive adaptation feature. We illustrate applicability of the coordinated actor model and consequently the proposed template by designing two real-life case studies in the domains of air traffic control systems and railway traffic control systems in Ptolemy II.", "references": ["A-survey-on-engineering-approaches-for-systems-Krupitzer-Roth/d64163ac9d7ad5bffda3d2cb78bd56319d65cfb6", "Stochastic-game-analysis-and-latency-awareness-for-C%C3%A1mara-Moreno/719a78cc3e88ee775d4b3a0c8232763abfcd4150", "Probabilistic-Verification-at-Runtime-for-Systems-Filieri-Tamburrelli/49a2b8f197272e34c5a174e303b7159e864019aa", "Incremental-Runtime-Verification-of-Probabilistic-Forejt-Kwiatkowska/0aff76e19803943175c4dd293ce51e7f97e08ad8", "Run-time-efficient-probabilistic-model-checking-Filieri-Ghezzi/74caebaafddeb27814f6f572638ffbaf6872b762", "A-Component-Architecture-for-the-Internet-of-Things-Brooks-Jerady/c5752fb41feb1be2a1c8c88650351867f1bea50e", "Comparing-Model-Based-Predictive-Approaches-to-and-Moreno-Papadopoulos/bd5902a7526ba71beb25cd428bb844c37cddb47a", "Formal-Design-and-Verification-of-Self-Adaptive-Arcaini-Riccobene/c3681656b53cea3cd9e9854a1be082c2d3cc4d50", "Adaptation-impact-and-environment-models-for-C%C3%A1mara-Lopes/8641be8daff5b24e98a0d68138a61456853aef82", "Coordinated-Actors-for-Reliable-Self-adaptive-Bagheri-Akkaya/861de9c40b7734ddba735a8edb4599a87b8887bb"]},

We use the maxmin share paradigm introduced by Budish~\\citeBudish:first as a measure for fairness. \\procacciafirst ~\\citeProcaccia:first were the first to investigate this fundamental problem in the additive setting. They show that a maxmin guarantee (1-$\\MMS$ allocation) is not always possible even when the number of agents is limited to 3. While the existence of an approximation solution (e.g. a $1/2$-$\\MMS$ allocation) is quite straightforward, improving the guarantee becomes subtler for larger constants. \\sprocacciafirst ~\\citeProcaccia:first provide a proof for the existence of a $2/3$-$\\MMS$ allocation and leave the question open for better guarantees. Our main contribution is an answer to the above question. We improve the result of \\sprocacciafirst~to a $3/4$ factor in the additive setting. The main idea for our $3/4$-$\\MMS$ allocation method is clustering the agents. To this end, we introduce three notions and techniques, namely reducibility, matching allocation, and cycle-envy-freeness, and prove the approximation guarantee of our algorithm via non-trivial applications of these techniques. Our analysis involves coloring and double counting arguments that might be of independent interest. One major shortcoming of the current studies on fair allocation is the additivity assumption on the valuations. We alleviate this by extending our results to the case of submodular, fractionally subadditive, and subadditive settings. More precisely, we give constant approximation guarantees for submodular and XOS agents, and a logarithmic approximation for the case of subadditive agents. Furthermore, we complement our results by providing close upper bounds for each class of valuation functions. Finally, we present algorithms to find such allocations for additive, submodular, and XOS settings in polynomial time.

Here, we present the first systematic and rigorous longitudinal study that addresses the following questions: 1) Do fingerprints of young children possess the salient features required to uniquely recognize a child? 2) If so, at what age can a child\u2019s fingerprints be captured with sufficient fidelity for recognition? 3) Can a child\u2019s fingerprints be used to reliably recognize the child as he ages? For this paper, we collected fingerprints of 309 children (0\u20135 years old) four different times over a one year period. We show, for the first time, that fingerprints acquired from a child as young as 6-h old exhibit distinguishing features necessary for recognition, and that state-of-the-art fingerprint technology achieves high recognition accuracy (98.9% true accept rate at 0.1% false accept rate) for children older than six months. In addition, we use mixed-effects statistical models to study the persistence of child fingerprint recognition accuracy and show that the recognition accuracy is not significantly affected over the one year time lapse in our data. Given rapidly growing requirements to recognize children for vaccination tracking, delivery of supplementary food, and national identification documents, this paper demonstrates that fingerprint recognition of young children (six months and older) is a viable solution based on available capture and recognition technology.", "references": ["Advances-in-Capturing-Child-Fingerprints%3A-A-High-Koda-Higuchi/ae3971195e7989f82a327db90702bba06cc453d6", "Giving-Infants-an-Identity%3A-Fingerprint-Sensing-and-Jain-Arora/3e400d19daaff3342134c3245743e01992303f18", "Longitudinal-study-of-fingerprint-recognition.-Yoon-Jain/3d1f65bff6b5803fa6d1af21b7debd64119846a1", "Recognizing-infants-and-toddlers-using-Increasing-Jain-Cao/3b7dad5892d135480745739c34ba1129f98336e7", "Probability-of-Random-Correspondence-for-Su-Srihari/dfea6f486865d92778f19fc02916087f8f7a80d6"]},

Such long range iris acquisition and recognition systems can provide high user convenience and improved throughput. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art design and implementation of iris-recognition-at-a-distance (IAAD) systems. In this regard, the design of such a system from both the image acquisition (hardware) and image processing (algorithms) perspectives are presented. The major contributions of this paper include: (1) discussing the significance and applications of IAAD systems in the context of human recognition, (2) providing a review of existing IAAD systems, (3) presenting a complete solution to the design problem of an IAAD system, from both hardware and algorithmic perspectives, (4) discussing the use of additional ocular information, along with iris, for improving IAAD accuracy, and (5) discussing the current research challenges and providing recommendations for future research in IAAD. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, these prefetchers require large on-chip meta-data storage, making previously-proposed designs impractical. Hence, to improve practicality, researchers have sought ways to enable timely prefetch while locating meta-data entirely off-chip. Unfortunately, current solutions for off-chip meta-data increase memory traffic by over a factor of three. We observe three requirements to store meta-data off chip: minimal off-chip lookup latency, bandwidth-efficient meta-data updates, and off-chip lookup amortized over many prefetches. In this work, we show: (1) minimal off-chip meta-data lookup latency can be achieved through a hardware-managed main memory hash table, (2) bandwidth-efficient updates can be performed through probabilistic sampling of meta-data updates, and (3) off-chip lookup costs can be amortized by organizing meta-data to allow a single lookup to yield long prefetch sequences. Using these techniques, we develop Sampled Temporal Memory Streaming (STMS), a practical address-correlating prefetcher that keeps predictor meta-data in main memory while achieving 90% of the performance potential of idealized on-chip meta-data storage.", "references": ["Low-Cost-Epoch-Based-Correlation-Prefetching-for-Chou/56514c2adbe546faf4c9d80187c742fb7ffe501f", "Timekeeping-in-the-Memory-System%3A-Predicting-and-Hu-Martonosi/20d8711439795c00bc75445af893a336dc440bb7", "Dead-block-prediction-%26-dead-block-correlating-Lai-Fide/e81e1f424ee5d87f7f1a8e01902b59728ffc5e3d"]},

These trends have significantly increased relative main-memory latencies as measured in processor clock cycles.

But cache memories are not always effective, either because they are not large enough to hold a program's working set, or because memory access patterns don't exhibit behavior that matches a cache memory's demand-driven, line-structured organization. To partially overcome cache memories' limitations, we organize data cache prefetch information in a new way, a GHB (global history buffer) supports existing prefetch algorithms more effectively than conventional prefetch tables.

Commercial server applications present a particular challenge for memory system design because current prefetching/streaming approaches are often ineffective on the irregular data structures and dependent miss chains characteristic of these applications. To further improve server performance, architects must design mechanisms that issue memory requests earlier and with greater parallelism in the face of complex access patterns. Despite their complexity, commercial applications nonetheless execute repetitive code sequences, which give rise to recurring data structure traversals. As a result, memory addresses are temporally-correlated\u2014addresses accessed near one another in time often recur together. By recording temporally-correlated cache miss addresses and using the recorded information to predict future misses, irregular yet repetitive miss patterns can be predicted.

The objective then is to find a partition, where each agent is guaranteed her maximin share. Such allocations do not always exist, hence we resort to approximation algorithms. Our main result is a 2/3-approximation that runs in polynomial time for any number of agents and goods.

We take advantage of the observation that equidistant prototypes embedding is an optimal embedding that maximizes the minimum one-against-the-rest margin between the classes. Rather than preserving the global or local structure of the training data, our method, called linear regression analysis (LRA), applies least-square regression technique to map gallery samples to the equally distant locations, regardless of the true structure of training data. Further, a novel generic learning method, which maps the intra-class facial differences of the generic faces to the zero vectors, is incorporated to enhance the generalization capability of LRA. Using this novel method, learning based on only a handful of generic classes can largely improve the face recognition performance, even when the generic data are collected from a different database and camera set-up. The incremental learning based on the Greville algorithm makes the mapping matrix efficiently updated from the newly coming gallery classes, training samples, or generic variations.

The authors propose a method for recognizing faces that is robust to certain types and levels of occlusion. They also present tests that allow to assess the incidence of the proposed method. Face detection and recognition are issues that are being widely studied due to the large number of applications they have. At present , we can find face recognition systems in social networking sites, photo management software and access control systems, to name a few. Face recognition presents several difficulties. The image of the human face can have large intra-subject variations (changes in the same individual) that make it difficult to develop a recognition system. Variations may arise, for example, from head position variation when taking the picture, differences in lighting, facial expression (laughter, anger, etc.), occlusion of parts of the face due to the use of accessories such as lenses, sunglasses and scarves, facial hair (mustache, beard, long hair, etc.), and changes in facial features due to aging. On the other hand, inter-subject variations (differences between individuals) can be very small between two people with similar traits, making correct identification difficult. Presently there are various methods of face recognition. However, when the image is occluded, those methods that extract global features (holistic features) (as Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces) cannot be applied. There are many approaches that deal with occlusion in face recognition. Among them we can mention the one proposed by Shermina and Vasudevan (2012) that propose block comparison and thresholding to detect occlusion in the query image and use Empirical Mode Decomposition (Huang et al., 1998) (EMD) to normalize facial expression. In Lang and Jing (2011) , Guillamet and Vitria (2002) and Lee and Seung (1999) the use of Non-negative Matrix Factor-ization is explored because the locality of this approach lends itself to deal with occlusions. In Chiang and Chen (2011) a occlusion resistant face recognition method is proposed in which the query image is first normalized to a common shape and then, its texture is reconstructed by using PCA for each specific person in the database , which in turn allows to identify the occluded pixels as the ones that are very different from the query image.

In this paper, we used these results to develop adaptive TV regularization schemes, as well as a scheme for automatic scale recognition. We develop our results by considering the unconstrained (Tikhonov) formulation of the TV regularization problem, in which a regularization parameter must be chosen to determine the balance between the goodness of t to the original (e.g. measured) data and the amount of regularization to be done to the image. We rst discuss how to choose the regularization parameter based on the local features of objects in the image by using the theory presented in 15]. We then discuss how to choose the regularization parameter based on the noise level in the image, and we nally discuss how to develop adaptive regularization schemes which are driven by both features and noise level in the image. We discuss several heuristics and give two schemes for doing adaptive regularization based on our results, which use a priori information to manually deene a spatially varying regularization parameter. Using the same theory, we also give a simple scheme for local scale recognition. Our results are equally applicable to the constrained formulation of the TV regularization problem, as well as to other geometry-driven diiusion schemes, as these other schemes can be thought of as variations or modiications of the model TV regularization scheme.", "references": ["Nonlinear-total-variation-based-noise-removal-Rudin-Osher/54205667c1f65a320f667d73c354ed8e86f1b9d9", "Spatially-adaptive-wavelet-based-multiscale-image-Banham-Katsaggelos/ba8df46359cc8515efd2c76b772fb54c59df1d80", "Iterative-Methods-for-Total-Variation-Image-1-Chan/45b4ab60476045d33155fced2ba82931d0a8fa65", "Geometry-Driven-Diffusion-in-Computer-Vision-Romeny/e62ffb7a63e063aedf046f8cf05b8aa47ddb930a"]},

C. Fu", "Janak H. Patel", "Bob L. Janssens"], "date": "1992", "abstract": "The execution of numerically intensive programs presents a challenge to memory system designers. Numerical program execution can be accelerated by pipelined arithmetic units, but to be effective, must be supported by high speed memory access. A cache memory is a well known hardware mechanism used to reduce the average memory access latency. Numerical programs, however, often have poor cache performance. Stride directed prefetching has been proposed to improve the cache performance of numerical programs executing on a vector processor, This paper shows how this approach can be extended to a scalar processor by using a simple hardware mechanism, called a stride prediction table (SPT), to calculate the stride distances of array accesses made from within the loop body of a program. The results using selected programs from the PERFECT and SPEC benchmarks show that stride directed prefetching on a scalar processor can significantly reduce the cache miss rate of particular programs and a SPT need only a small number of entries to be effective. the cache miss ratio for the scalar execution of the matrix multiply for matrix sizes of 100 x 100. For comparison purposes the corresponding vector execution is also shown. The results were obtained using trace driven simulation of 2 4 Kbyte cache with block sizes of 8, 16,32 and 64 bytes. The traces are from executions on an Alliant FX/80. Each trace is for single processor execution where the scalar and vector versions are generated using compiler optimizations. Two miss ratios are shown for each execution; ALL means that all memory data references am simulated and MATRIX means that only references to matrix data (data size of 8 bytes) are simulated. There are 19 and 2.2 million references for scalar and vector executions respectively but only 4 and 2 million of these references are to matrix data. Note that the vector miss ratios are computed relative to the number of vector accesses and not the number of vector referencing instructions. For example, a vector instruction may load 32 elements but this is counted as 32 vector accesses.", "references": []},

For such applications, correlation-based prefetching, which is ca- pable of capturing complex data access patterns, has been shown to be a more promising approach. However, the large instruction and data working sets of these applications require extremely large correlation tables, making these tables impractical to be im- plemented on-chip.

There is a large body of literature on prefetching for caches, and it is not clear how they can be adapted (or if the issues are different) for TLBs, how well suited they are for TLB prefetching, and how they compare with the recency prefetching mechanism.This paper presents the first detailed comparison of different prefetching mechanisms (previously proposed for caches) - arbitrary stride prefetching, and markov prefetching - for TLB entries, and evaluates their pros and cons.

In this paper we show that correlating prefetchers that work with tags instead of cache-line addresses are significantly more resource-efficient, providing equal or better p formance than previous proposals. We support this claim by showing that per-set tag sequences exhibit highly repetiti v patterns both within a set and across different sets. Becaus e a single tag sequence can capture multiple address sequence s spread over different cache sets, significant space savings can be achieved. We propose a tag-based prefetcher called a Tag Correlating Prefetcher (TCP). Even with very small history tables, TCP outperforms address-based correlating prefet chers many times larger. In addition, we show that such a prefetcher can yield most of its performance benefits if plac ed at the L2 level of an aggressive out-of-order processor. Onl y if one wants prefetching all the way up to L1, is dead-block prediction required.

First, a simple two-state approach is described in which the algorithm switches between the output of an identity filter and a rank-ordered mean (ROM) filter. The technique achieves an excellent tradeoff between noise suppression and detail preservation with little increase in computational complexity over the simple median filter. For a small additional cost in memory, this simple strategy is easily generalized into a multistate approach using weighted combinations of the identity and ROM filter in which the weighting coefficients can be optimized using image training data. Extensive simulations indicate that these methods perform significantly better in terms of noise suppression and detail preservation than a number of existing nonlinear techniques with as much as 40% impulse noise corruption.

These results are demonstrated on the publicly available YaleB and AR face datasets but have implications for the application of Compressive Sensing more broadly.", "references": ["Signal-Recovery-From-Random-Measurements-Via-Tropp-Gilbert/18c84e6b5f1d6da3c670454db3f0fa61266ab1e3", "Robust-Face-Recognition-via-Sparse-Representation-Wright-Yang/1512b9570669a9dfe2a252900ae94b276e3aff9e", "Feature-Selection-in-Face-Recognition-%3A-A-Sparse-13-Yang-Wright/0601416ade6707c689b44a5bb67dab58d5c27814", "Rapid-face-recognition-using-hashing-Shi-Li/b4d694961d3cde43ccef7d8fcf1061fe0d8f97f3", "Feature-hashing-for-large-scale-multitask-learning-Weinberger-Dasgupta/00bbfde6af97ce5efcf86b3401d265d42a95603d", "Hash-Kernels-Shi-Petterson/511b0bb924d109767feb11855acd059125ff0164", "Hash-Kernels-for-Structured-Data-Shi-Petterson/43afc11883fb147ac37b4dc40bf6e7fa5fccf341", "An-Introduction-To-Compressive-Sampling-Candes-Wakin/55b49e2302f389c1dd468e6414d871e44710320f"]},

To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Generic Learning (AGL) method, which adapts a generic discriminant model to better distinguish the persons with single face sample. As a specific implementation of the AGL, a Coupled Linear Representation (CLR) algorithm is proposed to infer, based on the generic training set, the within-class scatter matrix and the class mean of each person given its single enrolled sample. Thus, the traditional Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) can be applied to SSPP task.

Since it is very hard to fake an EEG signature or to attack an EEG biometric system, this paper presented a biometric security system that based on EEG signal processing. A new investigated method for person identification using the EEG Brain Signal processing is introduced. The proposed method based on executing a voting scheme between the 3 feature extraction methods which achieved maximum classification rates in the preliminary test. Preliminary test used Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) for features extraction with two different measures with each of them, thus a total of 4 different methods, produced 4 different features sets. Classification rates were 93%, 87% & 93% using the 3 recommended features sets. After executing the proposed voting scheme, classification rate increased to 100%, for 3 subjects' experiment which surpassed the results from the previous works in this application. Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network trained by a standard back propagation algorithm is used as a classifier.

We provide two practical alternatives for estimating this condition by observing that the filtering of the image and the noise can be approximated by a decoupling technique, with respect to the weight or time parameters. Our automatic algorithm obtains quite accurate results on a variety of synthetic and natural images, including piecewise smooth and textured ones. We assume that the statistics of the noise were previously estimated. No a priori knowledge regarding the characteristics of the clean image is required.

Here, u0 should capture \u201cessential features\u201d of f which are to be separated from the spurious components absorbed by v0, and \u03bb0 is a fixed threshold which dictates separation of scales. To proceed, we iterate the refinement step [uj+1, vj+1] = arginf J(vj , \u03bb02 j), leading to the hierarchical decomposition, f = \u2211k j=0 uj + vk.

We recorded the eye positions of human subjects while they viewed images of natural scenes. We report that active selection affected the statistics of the stimuli encountered by the fovea, and also by the parafovea up to eccentricities of 4 degrees. We found two related effects. First, subjects looked at image regions that had high spatial contrast. Second, in these regions, the intensities of nearby image points (pixels) were less correlated with each other than in images selected at random.

Therefore, for memory intensive workloads, it becomes more important to overlap multiple cache misses than to overlap slow memory operations with other computations. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to parallelize sequential cache misses, thereby increasing memory-level parallelism (MLP). Our idea is based on the value prediction, which was proposed originally as an instruction-level-parallelism (ILP) optimization to break true data dependencies. In this paper, we advocate value prediction in its capability to enhance MLP instead of ILP. We propose to use value prediction and value speculative execution only for prefetching so that the complex prediction validation and misprediction recovery mechanisms are avoided and only minor changes in the microarchitecture are needed. The same hardware modifications also enable aggressive memory disambiguation for prefetching. The experimental results show that our technique enhances MLP effectively and achieves significant speedups even with a simple stride value predictor.", "references": ["The-Predictability-of-Data-Values-Sazeides-Smith/4f105edc6d373f41b998871962189ab9b2adb601", "Exceeding-the-Dataflow-Limit-via-Value-Prediction-Lipasti-Shen/2042924d67accb118d6d73765c8738ed793b5166", "Speculative-Execution-based-on-Value-Prediction-the-Gabbay/b7c9efd81382765b3cc82ec756e86ccbb5f39d1e", "Value-Locality-and-Load-Value-Prediction-Lipasti-Wilkerson/180189c3e8b0f783a8df6a1887a94a5e3f82148b"]},

This has the effect that the behavior of a program can be modified according to the context of its use without the need to mention such context dependencies in the affected base program. We illustrate these ideas by providing different UI views on the same object while, at the same time, keeping the conceptual simplicity of object-oriented programming that objects know by themselves how to behave, in our case how to display themselves.

In this paper, we describe and evaluate the performance of three variations of a hardware function unit whose goal is to assist a data cache in prefetching data accesses so that memory latency is hidden as often as possible. The basic idea of the prefetching scheme is to keep track of data access patterns in a Reference Prediction Table (RPT) organized as an instruction cache. The three designs differ mostly on the timing of the prefetching. In the simplest scheme (basic), prefetches can be generated one iteration ahead of actual use. The lookahead variation takes advantage of a lookahead program counter that ideally stays one memory latency time ahead of the real program counter and that is used as the control mechanism to generate the prefetches. Finally the correlated scheme uses a more sophisticated design to detect patterns across loop levels. These designs are evaluated by simulating the ten SPEC benchmarks on a cycle-by-cycle basis. The results show that 1) the three hardware prefetching schemes all yield significant reductions in the data access penalty when compared with regular caches, 2) the benefits are greater when the hardware assist augments small on-chip caches, and 3) the lookahead scheme is the preferred one cost-performance wise.", "references": ["Design-and-Evaluation-of-a-Compiler-Algorithm-for-Mowry-Lam/2407c5ccddbc8752471e4aed21fcd3626b727e57", "Improving-the-Accuracy-of-Dynamic-Branch-Prediction-Pan-So/87e25e08f0b0e2e6de87b519c6b8d60fb41a31b4", "Prefetch-unit-for-vector-operations-on-scalar-Sklen%C3%A1r/eaaf1375a2bd2ae306c80e27533a16fef8824d46", "Stride-directed-prefetching-in-scalar-processors-Fu-Patel/ba0043bd748bb26a1ba2a8297df6320d8df7489d", "An-Architecture-for-Software-Controlled-Data-Klaiber-Levy/37e54946be8bb38fbdb036ec5728518aacfbc13b", "An-effective-on-chip-preloading-scheme-to-reduce-Baer-Chen/d51ad15fa164c1bf6b40bc183864667cc2cff7f9", "Data-Access-Microarchitectures-for-Superscalar-with-Chen-Mahlke/236aac079f2f8524f30e31da077fecccda50c84e", "Data-prefetching-in-multiprocessor-vector-cache-Fu-Patel/9e18c5913bb894be09e73de9947136c613120f9a", "Compiler-directed-data-prefetching-in-with-memory-Gornish-Granston/37f1436221d082ee756af5a7d960b896b0f20869"]},

Mitra", "Tian-Hu Yu"], "date": "1994", "abstract": "Images are often corrupted by impulse noise from a noisy sensor or channel transmission errors. The goal of impulse noise removal is to suppress the noise while preserving the edges and the details. To this end, nonlinear techniques have been found to provide more satisfactory results in comparison to linear methods. The two often used nonlinear methods are the median filter and the outlier method. In median filtering the central pixel inside a window is replaced by the median value of all pixels in the window. However, median filtering not only removes impulse noise but also introduces distortion, in particular, for highly corrupted images. The outlier method is based on a detection-estimation strategy in which the impulse noise is detected first and then an average of all pixel values inside a window centered at the detected corrupted pixel is used as an estimate of its true value. This approach is also not effective for highly corrupted images. Recently, we proposed an efficient method to remove impulse noise from a highly corrupted image also based on a detection-estimation strategy, in which the impulse noise is detected first using a simple quadratic filter. and a selectively chosen local mean is used to estimate the true value of the corrupted pixel. A major limitation of this approach is that often it has to be applied twice to arrive at a satisfactory result. This second run not only increases computational cost but also reduce the quality of the processed image. In this paper, we analyze the limitation of this newly proposed method of impulse noise removal, and then advance a modified version which does not require a second run.", "references": []},

The RCRS filters are developed within the general framework of rank selection (RS) filters, which are filters constrained to output an order statistic from the observation set. Many previously proposed rank order based filters can be formulated as RS filters. The only difference between such filters is in the information used in deciding which order statistic to output. The information used by RCRS filters is the ranks of selected input samples, hence the name rank conditioned rank selection filters. The number of input sample ranks used is referred to as the order of the RCRS filter. The order can range from zero to the number of samples in the observation window, giving the filters valuable flexibility. Low-order filters can give good performance and are relatively simple to optimize and implement. If improved performance is demanded, the order can be increased but at the expense of filter simplicity. In this paper, many statistical and deterministic properties of the RCRS filters are presented. A procedure for optimizing over the class of RCRS filters is also presented. Finally, extensive computer simulation results that illustrate the performance of RCRS filters in comparison with other techniques in image restoration applications are presented.", "references": ["Fast-adaptation-and-performance-characteristics-of-Yin-Neuvo/87960076ab69794a4dcdd272c6bc36f097980793", "Permutation-Filters-%3A-A-Class-of-Non-%7B-Barner-ArceDepartment/935416b9a771ca9093bc9301eb73179cbc0f78a1", "Adaptive-Stack-Filtering-with-Application-to-Image-Yia-Astola/e459f1de733b07888a0f9fc129d2922fb647c839", "Analysis-of-the-properties-of-median-and-weighted-Yli-Harja-Astola/f70811aa4d8733dc2629cede2da5dff7b067eda0"]},

WEG 1 and 2 use much the same scheme, except there the multiplier changes only on macroblock boundaria. We propose a method for perceptual optimization of the set of multipliers. We compute the perceptual error for each block based upon DCT quantization error adjusted according to contrast sensitivity, light adaptation, and contrast masking, and pick the set of multipliers which yield maximally flat perceptual error over the blocks of the image.

Two basic predictor models are defined: Computational predictors perform an operation on previous values to yield predicted next values. Examples we study are stride value prediction (which adds a delta to a previous value) and last value prediction (which performs the trivial identity operation on the previous value); Context Based} predictors match recent value history (context) with previous value history and predict values based entirely on previously observed patterns. To understand the potential of value prediction we perform simulations with unbounded prediction tables that are immediately updated using correct data values. Simulations of integer SPEC95 benchmarks show that data values can be highly predictable. Best performance is obtained with context based predictors; overall prediction accuracies are between 56% and 91%. The context based predictor typically has an accuracy about 20% better than the computational predictors (last value and stride). Comparison of context based prediction and stride prediction shows that the higher accuracy of context based prediction is due to relatively few static instructions giving large improvements; this suggests the usefulness of hybrid predictors. Among different instruction types, predictability varies significantly. In general, load and shift instructions are more difficult to predict correctly, whereas add instructions are more predictable.", "references": []},

Because computations often require more data from cache per floating-point operation than a machine can deliver and because operations are pipelined, idle computational cycles are common when scientific applications are executed. To overcome these bottlenecks, programmers have learned to use a coding style that ensures a better balance between memory references and floating-point operations. In our view, this is a step in the wrong direction because it makes programs more machine-specific. A programmer should not be required to write a new program version for each new machine; instead, the task of specializing a program to a target machine should be left to the compiler.\nBut is our view practical? Can a sophisticated optimizing compiler obviate the need for the myriad of programming tricks that have found their way into practice to improve the performance of the memory hierarchy? In this paper we attempt to answer that question. To do so, we develop and evaluate techniques that automatically restructure program loops to achieve high performance on specific target architectures. These methods attempt to balance computation and memory accesses and seek to eliminate or reduce pipeline interlock. To do this, they estimate statically the balance between memory operations and floating-point operations for each loop in a particular program and use these estimates to determine whether to apply various loop transformations.\nExperiments with our automatic techniques show that integer-factor speedups are possible on kernels. Additionally, the estimate of the balance between memory operations and computation, and the application of the estimate are very accurate\u2014experiments reveal little difference between the balance achieved by our automatic system that is made possible by hand optimization.", "references": []},

In reality, the interactive identification of the control points on both images is tedious, difficult, and often a source of error. We propose a two-step algorithm to automatically identify homologous regions that are used as a priori information during the image registration procedure. First, a number of small control volumes having distinct anatomical features are identified on the model image in a somewhat arbitrary fashion. Instead of attempting to find their correspondences in the reference image through user interaction, in the proposed method, each of the control regions is mapped to the corresponding part of the reference image by using an automated image registration algorithm. A normalized cross-correlation (NCC) function or mutual information was used as the auto-mapping metric and a limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm (L-BFGS) was employed to optimize the function to find the optimal mapping. For rigid registration, the transformation parameters of the system are obtained by averaging that derived from the individual control volumes. In our deformable calculation, the mapped control volumes are treated as the nodes or control points with known positions on the two images. If the number of control volumes is not enough to cover the whole image to be registered, additional nodes are placed on the model image and then located on the reference image in a manner similar to the conventional BSpline deformable calculation. For deformable registration, the established correspondence by the auto-mapped control volumes provides valuable guidance for the registration calculation and greatly reduces the dimensionality of the problem. The performance of the two-step registrations was applied to three rigid registration cases (two PET-CT registrations and a brain MRI-CT registration) and one deformable registration of inhale and exhale phases of a lung 4D CT. Algorithm convergence was confirmed by starting the registration calculations from a large number of initial transformation parameters. An accuracy of approximately 2 mm was achieved for both deformable and rigid registration. The proposed image registration method greatly reduces the complexity involved in the determination of homologous control points and allows us to minimize the subjectivity and uncertainty associated with the current manual interactive approach. Patient studies have indicated that the two-step registration technique is fast, reliable, and provides a valuable tool to facilitate both rigid and nonrigid image registrations.", "references": []},

For each patient, the correlation between inhale and exhale phases was studied and quantified using a BSpline deformable model. Images at an arbitrary phase were deduced by an interpolation of the deformation coefficients. The accuracy of the proposed scheme was assessed by comparing marker trajectories and by checkerboard/difference display of the interpolated and acquired images.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe images at intermediate phases could be derived by an interpolation of the deformation field. An analysis of marker movements indicated that 3 mm accuracy is achievable by the interpolation. The subtraction of image analysis indicated a similar level of success. The proposed technique was useful also for automatically mapping the organ contours in a known phase to other phases, and for designing patient-specific margins in the presence of respiratory motion. Finally, the technique led to a 90% reduction in the acquired data, because in the BSpline model, a lattice of only a few thousand values is sufficient to describe a CT data set of 25 million pixels.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOrgan deformation can be well modeled by using a BSpline model. The proposed technique may offer useful means for radiation dose reduction, binning artifacts removal, and disk storage improvement in 4D imaging.", "references": []},

NASA's success with reconstruction algorithms on the HST has lead to an effort to develop software that can aid and in some cases replace complicated, expensive and error-prone hardware. Among the many applications is HST's replacement, the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST). This work details the theory of optical wavefront reconstruction, reviews some numerical methods for this problem, and presents a novel numerical technique which we call extended least squares. We compare the performance of these numerical methods for potential inclusion in prototype NGST optical wavefront reconstruction software. We begin with a tutorial of Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction theory. 1. Introduction. The history of science is filled with misfortunes that have been transformed into scientific triumphs. This article describes some of the scientific progress in numerical methods for wavefront reconstruction that contributed to the eventual and remarkable successes of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Shortly after launch on April 24, 1990, it was discovered that the primary mirror of the HST suffered from a large spherical aberration [23]. Several teams of researchers were dispatched to apply a variety of image processing techniques to the flight data of stellar images in order to identify the aberration and aid in the design of corrective optics. Burrows [22] and Lyon et al. [81] applied parametric techniques; Fienup [46] applied gradient-based algorithms; Fienup et al. [47] and Roddier [104] applied nonparametric projection techniques; Redding et al. [102] and Meinel et al. [84] applied ray tracing and diffraction propagation techniques and Barrett and Sandler [8] applied neural network techniques. The results of all groups were used in conjunction with archival HST manufacturing records to pinpoint the size and source of the error. It wasn't until 1993 that corrective optics were installed. In the meantime, researchers continued with efforts to model the telescope with enough precision to recover unaberrated images through post-processing. In addition to the gross manufacturing errors, researchers were able to identify aberrations due to the polish marks on the primary and secondary mirrors. Again, wavefront reconstruction techniques played an important role in this effort [71]. During this time much was learned about reconstruction algorithms. An important lesson learned from the HST is that relatively simple software can aid and in some cases replace complicated and sensitive optical systems.

In this paper, we investigate an effective approach to the clustering of image data based on the technique of fractal image coding, a method first introduced in conjunction with fractal image compression technique. A joint fractal coding technique, applicable to pairs of images, is used to determine the degree of their similarity. Images in a visual database can be categorized in clusters on the basis of their similarity to a set of iconic images. Classification metrics are proposed for the measurement of the extent of similarity among images. By experimenting on a large set of texture and natural images, we demonstrate the applicability of these metrics and the proposed clustering technique to various visual database applications.", "references": ["A-Visual-Information-Management-System-for-the-of-Bach-Paul/c780431047add3c92ec646ce083a8b89b90a9037", "Textural-Features-Corresponding-to-Visual-Tamura-Mori/597edc3174dc9f26badd67c4e81d0e8a58f9dbb3"]},

For deformable models and templates, the extraction of a shape is obtained through the minimization of an energy composed of an internal regularization term (not necessary in the case of parametric models) and an external attraction potential. Two-step iterative algorithms have been often used where, at each iteration, the model is first locally deformed according to the potential data attraction and then globally smoothed (or fitted in the parametric case). We show how these approaches can be interpreted as the introduction of auxiliary variables and the minimization of a two-variables energy. The first variable corresponds to the original model we are looking for, while the second variable represents an auxiliary shape close to the first one. This permits to transform an implicit data constraint defined by a non convex potential into an explicit convex reconstruction problem. This approach is much simpler since each iteration is composed of two simple to solve steps. Our formulation permits a more precise setting of parameters in the iterative scheme to ensure convergence to a minimum.

But nine are too many. A dramatic chain of events leads the reader, at last, to the exact estimate: If five points are given in a triangle of area 1, then there are three of them that form a triangle of area not exceeding 1/4 (and this is not true ifwe replace \"five\" by \"four\" ). Now the author gives an interesting generalization of the problem: he considers an arbitrary convex figure (of area instead of the triangle. The first result (the upper estimate) is the following: If six points are situated in a convex figure of area 1, then there are three of them that form a triangle of area not exceeding . But this does not remain true if we replace \"six\" by \"four\"! This negative result (four is too few) is difficult. The author reduces it to the following problem of a Polish mathematician C. Radziszewski: Prove that for any convex figure ofarea 1, there exists an inscribed parallelogram ofarea no less than 1/2. And now the reader gets a \"Fifty Dollar Problem\" (that is, the author will pay $50 for its first solution): For what convex figures it is not possible to replace \"six\" by \"five\" in above \"upper estimate\"? The concluding part of the book (the last two and a half chapters) is devoted to some combinatorial problems that are connected with its main contents. We indicate the following problem of a Hungarian mathematician Sas: Prove that for every convex figure of area there exists an inscribed n-gon of area not less than n/ (2r) sin 2r / n (this is the area of the regular n-gon inscribed in the circle of area ). For n 3 this problem was positively solved by W. Blaschke in 1917. There are in the last three chapters of the book several problems by B. Grunbaum, P. Erd6s, the author, and other mathematicians. Among them there are three \"Twenty Dollar Problems\" composed by Erd6s-Soifer. The monies for the first solutions of these problems were paid to young mathematicians who sent the composers solutions, and Soifer recounts the ideas oftheir solutions. The book contains many problems (solved and unsolved), many results and ideas, descriptions of several modern mathematical methods, and interesting notes and points of view. It remains to add that some remarks, opinions, historical details, and description of the author\u2019s talks with such famous mathematicians as A. Kolmogorov and P. Erd6s, as well as four interesting introductions written by well-known mathematicians are inserted in the book. This makes the book alive, fresh, and easily readable.

The projection onto convex sets (POCS) algorithm, in which an initial estimate is sequentially projected onto the individual sets according to a periodic schedule, has been the most prevalent tool to solve such problems. Nonetheless, POCS has several shortcomings: it converges slowly, it is ill suited for implementation on parallel processors, and it requires the computation of exact projections at each iteration. We propose a general parallel projection method (EMOPSP) that overcomes these shortcomings. At each iteration of EMOPSP, a convex combination of subgradient projections onto some of the sets is formed and the update is obtained via relaxation. The relaxation parameter may vary over an iteration-dependent, extrapolated range that extends beyond the interval [0,2] used in conventional projection methods. EMOPSP not only generalizes existing projection-based schemes, but it also converges very efficiently thanks to its extrapolated relaxations.

The problem is to obtain a clear image from raw data. The raw data themselves could represent an image, however, the image is often blurry and noise corrupted. Throughout this work, we assume that we know how the blurring occurs. We will also assume some knowledge of the signal-to-noise ratio and the spectral content of the noise. The process we have in mind may be modeled in the following way. Let u(x), x = (x 1 ; x 2) represent grey-level values of an image on the x 1 x 2-plane. We will assume for simplicity that the picture eld is a unit square. In addition, the image u is subject to periodic boundary conditions. All of the results we describe can be extended or modiied to include other simple domains and boundary conditions. Throughout the paper, we will consistently use u 0 to denote the desired, true image. The true image u 0 (x) is related to the measured raw data g(x) by Au 0 + = g: (1) Here g is assumed to contain unknown noise , and thus may not lie in the range of the blurring operator A. For preciseness and simplicity, let us assume that A is a convolution operator with a Gaussian kernel: Au](x) = Z exp(?jx ? x 0 j 2)u(x 0)dx 0 : (2) In the limit ! 1, A is the identity, and no blurring occurs.

Another important observation is Parseval's theorem, which speciies that the Fourier transform preserves the Euclidean distance in the time or frequency domain. Having thus mapped sequences to a lower-dimensionality space by using only the rst few Fourier coeecients, we use R-trees to index the sequences and eeciently answer similarity queries.

The evaluation procedure employed does not depend on the set of features used with each algorithm or the pattern recognition scheme. Rather, what is examined is the amount of texturecontext information contained in the spatial gray level dependence matrices, the gray level run length matrices, the gray level difference density functions, and the power spectrum. The comparison will be performed in two steps. First, only Markov generated textures will be considered. The Markov textures employed are similar to the ones used by perceptual psychologist B. Julesz in his investigations of human texture perception. These Markov textures provide a convenient mechanism for generating certain example texture pairs which are important in the analysis process. In the second part of the analysis the results obtained by considering only Markov textures will be extended to all textures which can be represented by translation stationary random fields of order two. This generalization clearly includes a much broader class of textures than Markovian ones.

The comments, critiques, and summaries that accompany the chapters are very helpful in crystalizing the ideas and answering questions that may arise, particularly to the self-learner. The transparency in the presentation of the material in the book equips the reader to proceed quickly to a wealth of problems included at the end of each chapter. These problems ranging from elementary to research-level are very valuable in that a solid working knowledge of the invariant imbedding techniques is acquired as well as good insight in attacking problems in various applied areas. Furthermore, a useful selection of references is given at the end of each chapter. This book may not appeal to those mathematicians who are interested primarily in the sophistication of mathematical theory, because the authors have deliberately avoided all pseudo-sophistication in attaining transparency of exposition. Precisely for the same reason the majority of the intended readers who are applications-oriented and are eager to use the techniques quickly in their own fields will welcome and appreciate the efforts put into writing this book. From a purely mathematical point of view, some of the invariant imbedding results may be considered to be generalizations of the classical theory of first-order partial differential equations, and a part of the analysis of invariant imbedding is still at a somewhat heuristic stage despite successes in many computational applications. However, those who are concerned with mathematical rigor will find opportunities to explore the foundations of the invariant imbedding method. In conclusion, let me quote the following: \"What is the best method to obtain the solution to a problem'? The answer is, any way that works.\" (Richard P. Feyman, Engineering and Science, March 1965, Vol. XXVIII, no. 6, p. 9.) In this well-written book, Bellman and Wing have indeed accomplished the task of introducing the simplicity of the invariant imbedding method to tackle various problems of interest to engineers, physicists, applied mathematicians, and numerical analysts.", "references": []},

In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications.", "references": ["Gray-Level-Manipulation-Experiments-for-Texture-Troy-Deutsch/98c0a66922b1264f5f0c3325164f9d90d4ba5d2d", "Image-processing-by-digital-computer-Andrews-Tescher/cdcf628beb3bea4f2792c89e481795f191c8eef5", "Introduction-to-Statistical-Pattern-Recognition-Fxnxqdjd/5aadbc0e624e23cc4b9627ee87fcc1e79fc1bb64"]},

Canny"], "date": "1986", "abstract": "This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.", "references": ["Theory-of-edge-detection.-Marr-Hildreth/f62fbec04ed3a4625a1bc4e83e6766e9b74673cc"]},

Moreover, it minimizes distance and is nonexpansive, and therefore shares two of the more important properties of ordinary linear orthogonal projections onto closed linear manifolds. In this paper, we exploit the properties of these operators to develop several iterative algorithms for image restoration from partial data which permit any number of nonlinear constraints of a certain type to be subsumed automatically. Their common conceptual basis is as follows. Every known property of an original image f is envisaged as restricting it to lie in a well-defined closed convex set. Thus, m such properties place f in the intersection E0 = Ei of the corresponding closed convex sets E1,E2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Em. Given only the projection operators Pi onto the individual Ei's, i = 1 \u2192 m, we restore f by recursive means. Clearly, in this approach, the realization of the Pi's in a Hilbert space setting is one of the major synthesis problems. Section I describes the geometrical significance of the three main theorems in considerable detail, and most of the underlying ideas are illustrated with the aid of simple diagrams. Section II presents rules for the numerical implementation of 11 specific projection operators which are found to occur frequently in many signal-processing applications, and the Appendix contains proofs of all the major results.", "references": ["Is-it-possible-to-restore-an-optical-object-from-Stark-Cahana/a954b5c184bb2eb9ab12fb123e45f21dc71a7f66", "Fixed-point-Theorems-for-Noncompact-Mappings-in-Browder/d79630c62cd94b9019ba616e165a16479a87cd0a", "Signal-Reconstruction-from-Phas-Hayes-JAE/7d85f964400f5b7f32940850d53d47a28a54a35b"]},

In particular, we use the technique to construct algorithms and data structures for circular range searching, half-space range searching, and computing k-nearest neighbors in a variety of metrics. For each problem and each query, the response to the query is provided in O(k) or O(k + log n) time where k is the size of the response and n is the size of the problem. (E.g., for the n-point k-nearest neighbors problem, the k-nearest neighbors of any query point are provided in O(k -4log n) steps.) Depending on the problem being solved, the space required for the data structure is either linear or O(n log n). Hence, the time bounds are optimal and the space bounds are optimal or near-optimal. Previously known data structures for these problems required a factor of ~(log n(log log n) 2) or ~(log n log log n) more space and/or more time to answer each query. Our compaction technique incorporates planar separators, filtering search, and the probabilistic method for discrepancy problems. The fundamental idea is that k'h-order Voronoi diagrams (and other suitable proximity diagrams) can be compacted from k\u00b0(1)n space to O(n) space and still retain all the information that is essential for solving query problems. This result is of independent interest and may be useful in improving the memory space requirement or the query-time bound for other query-retrieval problems.

Hildreth"], "date": "1980", "abstract": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of delta 2G(x,y)*I(x,y) for image I, where G(x,y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and delta 2 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially.

This description is called the raw primal sketch.

Our method is direct and more general than the conventional approach that relies on the Wishart Ensemble and the combination of QR and Cholesky decomposition. Directly based on this p.d.f., and its interpretation by statistical mechanics, we give the physics proof that in the thermodynamic limit ( N \u2192 \u221e), the singular value distribution satisfies the quadrant law, similar to the celebrated semi-circle law established by Wigner more than 40 years ago for the spectral distribution of Gaussian Orthogonal (or Unitary) Ensembles.

(3) For each mask orientation and size, matching takes place between pairs of zero-crossings or terminationss of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region.

Based on both psychophysical and neurophysiological evidence, it was decided that an appropriate class of patterns would be those with a linearly varying spatial wavelength. Thresholds were measured both for patterns in which the spatial wavelength increased linearly with eccentricity and for patterns in which it decreased linearly with eccentricity. The results demonstrate that spatial inhomogeneity is indeed an important factor in the threshold visibility of gratings. The data support medium bandwidth estimates for the mechanisms underlying spatial frequency selectivity, and they are inconsistent with the notion that the visual system Performs a Fourier analysis of visual images. The data can be fit quantitatively by a semi-empirical model which postulates that the sensitivity to all spatial frequencies is highest in the fovea, but that the sensitivity to high frequencies declines more rapidly than that to low frequencies with increasing eccentricity.

The model quantitatively predicts the spatial modulation transfer function (cosine grating thresholds) under both sustained and transient conditions with no free parameters.", "references": []},

We conclude that: 1) \"Orthodox\" sampling theory methods are useful in problems where we have a known model (sampling distribution) for the properties of the noise, but no appreciable prior information about the quantities being estimated. 2) MAXENT is optimal in problems where we have prior information about multiplicities, but no noise. 3) The full Bayesian solution includes both of these as special cases and is needed in problems where we have both prior information and noise. 4) AR models are in one sense a special case of MAXENT, but in another sense they are ubiquitous in all spectral analysis problems with discrete time series. 5) Empirical methods such as Blackman-Tukey, which do not invoke even a likelihood function, are useful in the preliminary, exploratory phase of a problem where our knowledge is sufficient to permit intuitive judgments about how to organize a calculation (smoothing, decimation, windows, prewhitening, padding with zeroes, etc.) but insufficient to set up a quantitative model which would do the proper things for us automatically and optimally.", "references": ["Maximum-entropy-and-conditional-probability-Campenhout-Cover/92c209e326e38bccfcac4670d31a989fda25a9b4", "Image-reconstruction-from-incomplete-and-noisy-data-Gull-Daniell/f877039f938f84ced099513832b2758e82e07cce"]},

These are given by the values of the spectral parameters at the divisors corresponding to eigenvector line bundles over the associated spectral curves, defined within a given matrix representation. A Liouville generating function is obtained in completely separated form and shown, through the Liouville-Arnold integration method, to lead to the Abel map linearization of all Hamiltonian flows induced by the spectral invariants. The results are formulated in terms of sheaves to allow for singu-larities due to a degenerate spectrum. Serre duality is used to define a natural symplectic structure on the space of line bundles of suitable degree over a permissible class of spectral curves, and this is shown to be equivalent to the Kostant-Kirillov symplectic structure on rational coadjoint orbits, reduced by the group of constant loops. A similar construction involving a framing at infinity is given for the nonreduced orbits. The general construction is given for g = gl(r) or sl(r), with reductions to orbits of subalgebras determined as invariant fixed point sets under involutive automorphisms. As illustrative examples, the case g = sl(2), together with its real forms, is shown to reproduce the classical integration methods for finite dimensional systems defined on quadrics, with the Liouville generating function expressed in hyperellipsoidal coordinates, as well as the quasi-periodic solutions of the cubically nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation. For g = sl(3), the method is applied to the computation of quasi-periodic solutions of the two component coupled nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation.

Rains"], "date": "1998", "abstract": "We show that the moments of the trace of a random unitary matrix have combinatorial interpretations in terms of longest increasing subsequences of permutations. To be precise, we show that the 2n-th moment of the trace of a random k-dimensional unitary matrix is equal to the number of permutations of length n with no increasing subsequence of length greater than k. We then generalize this to other expectations over the unitary group, as well as expectations over the orthogonal and symplectic groups. In each case, the expectations count objects with restricted \u201cincreasing subsequence\u201d length. Introduction Much work has been done in the combinatorial literature on the \u201cincreasing subsequence problem\u201d, that of studying the distribution of the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation. The problem was first considered by Hammersley ([5]); good summaries can be found in [1] and [10], which gives an alternate proof of Theorem 1.1. This problem is also closely connected to the representation theory of Sn, particularly the theory of Young tableaux. The representation theory aspects are covered in [13]; section 5.1.4 in [8] gives a good treatment of the more elementary Young tableaux results. The results reported here arose from the observation that a certain partial sum of characters of the symmetric group that occurs naturally in the increasing subsequence problem also appears when calculating certain expectations over the unitary group. In particular, it turns out that the distribution of the length of the longest increasing subsequence can be expressed exactly in terms of the moments of the trace of a random (uniformly distributed) unitary matrix. This correspondence generalizes both to other moments for the unitary group, and to the moments of the trace of a random orthogonal or symplectic matrix. In each case, the moments count objects (colored permutations, signed permutations, or fixed-point-free involutions) with restricted increasing subsequence length. Section 1 states and proves the connection between the classical increasing subsequence problem and the unitary group. Section 2 extends this to other increasing subsequence problems connected to the unitary group, including an increasing subsequence problem for signed permutations (the hyperoctahedral group).

Lafayette, IN 47907 U.S.A. spa@cs.purdue.edu In combinatorics and analysis of algorithms often a Poisson version of a problem (called further Poisson model or poissonization) is easier to solve than the original one, which we name here as the Bernoulli model. Poissonization is a technique that replaces the original input (e.g., think of balls thrown to urns) by a Poisson process (e.g., think of balls arriving according to a Poisson process to urns). More precisely, analytical Poisson transform maps a sequence (e.g., characterizing the Bernoulli model) into a generating function of a complex variable. However, after poissonization one must depoissonize in order to translate the results of the Poisson model into the original (i.e\" Bernoulli) model. We present in this paper several analytical depoissonization results that fall into the following general scheme: if the Poisson transform has an appropriate growth in the complex plane, then an asymptotic expansion of the sequence can be expressed in terms of the Poisson transform and its derivatives evaluated on the real line. Not unexpectedly, actual formulations of depoissonization results depend on the nature of the growth , and thus we have polynomial and exponential depoissonization theorems. Renormalization (e.g., as in the central limit theorem) introduces another twist that led us to formulate the so called diagonal depoissonization theorems.

The signal is modeled as a linear combination of its past values and present and past values of a hypothetical input to a system whose output is the given signal. In the frequency domain, this is equivalent to modeling the signal spectrum by a pole-zero spectrum. The major part of the paper is devoted to all-pole models. The model parameters are obtained by a least squares analysis in the time domain. Two methods result, depending on whether the signal is assumed to be stationary or nonstationary. The same results are then derived in the frequency domain. The resulting spectral matching formulation allows for the modeling of selected portions of a spectrum, for arbitrary spectral shaping in the frequency domain, and for the modeling of continuous as well as discrete spectra. This also leads to a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the least squares error criterion. A spectral interpretation is given to the normalized minimum prediction error. Applications of the normalized error are given, including the determination of an \"optimal\" number of poles. The use of linear prediction in data compression is reviewed. For purposes of transmission, particular attention is given to the quantization and encoding of the reflection (or partial correlation) coefficients. Finally, a brief introduction to pole-zero modeling is given.", "references": ["A-view-of-three-decades-of-linear-filtering-theory-Kailath/0379b3842e4d504fe0cc927bbaed67ccb64ef61f", "Image-Data-Compression-by-Predictive-Coding-I%3A-Kobayashi-Bahl/24f81136ea3e59c2be432adacb8b6b54fb265e17", "A-spectral-characterization-of-the-ill-conditioning-Ekstrom/cce25383e5afa1158d07ad87fcefa526edd202e9"]},

It partitions a sequence of length n into variable phrases such that a new phrase is the shortest substring not seen in the past as a phrase. The parameter of interest is the number M n of phrases that one can construct from a sequence of length n. In this paper, for the memoryless source with unequal probabilities of symbols generation we derive the limiting distribution of M n which turns out to be normal. This proves a long standing open problem. In fact, to obtain this result we solved another open problem, namely, that of establishing the limiting distribution of the internal path length in a digital search tree. The latter is a consequence of an asymptotic solution of a multiplicative differentialfunctional equation often arising in the analysis of algorithms on words. Interestingly enough, our findings are proved by a combination of probabilistic techniques such as renewal equation and uniform integrability, and analytical techniques such as Mellin transform, difIerentialfunctional equations, de-Poissonlzation, and so forth.

[As noted elsewhere in this issue, this month is also the tenth anniversary of Wiener\u2019s death (March 18, 1964).] Not only was this work the direct cause for the great activity of the last three decades in signal estimation, but it was perhaps the greatest factor in bringing the statistical point of view clearly into communication theory and also control theory. It may suffice to quote Shannon\u2019s own major acknowledgment: \u201cCredit should also be given to Professor N. Wiener, whose elegant solution of the problems of filtering and prediction of stationary ensembles has considerably influenced the writer\u2019s thinking in this field.\u201d The subject of estimation is a vast one, and most of our attention will be devoted to the particular problems of linear least-squares estimation, or linear Jiltering as it has generally come to be called in the engineering literature. Even though least-squares estimation is clearly only a small part of the possible forms of estimation theory, in the author\u2019s opinion it is perhaps the most interesting and most important part. Least-squares theory not only provides useful solutions to certain specific estimation problems, but it also has connections to and implications for a surprisingly large number of other problems, both statistical and deterministic. As some examples we mention signal detection [93], [291]; the calculation of mutual information in certain channels [303] ; the solution of integral equations [288], [292], two-point boundary value problems in many", "references": ["On-the-factorization-of-rational-matrices-Youla/c6e6b35351b6d18932dcfb014ecb6b81c337991f"]},

Lafayette, IN 47907 U.S.A. Digital tries occur in a variety of compllter and communication algorithms including symbolic manipulations, compiling, comparison based searching and sorting, digital retrieval techniques, algorithms on strings, file systems, codes and communication protocols. We study the depth of the PATRICIA trie in a probabilistic framework. The PATRICIA trle is a digital tree in which nodes that would otherwise have only one branch have been collapsed into nodes having more than one branch. Because of this characteristic, the depth of the PATRICIA trie provides a measure on the compression of the keys stored in the trie. Here we consider n independent keys that are random strings of symbols from a V-ary alphabet where the occurrence of the i-th symbol of the alphabet in a key is given by pi, i = 1,2, ... ,V. This model is known as the Bernoulli model. We show that the limiting distribution in the asymmetric case (Le., symbols from the alphabet do not occur with the same probability) is normal with mean log n/H +0(1) and variance c\u00b7log n+O(1) where c is an explicit constant. In the symmetric case, which surprisingly proved to be more difficult, we present a limiting generating function, the limiting distribution, and as a result of these, the moments [or the depth. In either case, our results lead us to the conclusion that the PATRICIA trie is with high probability a well-balanced tree. \"This research was in paIl supported by AFOSR grant 90-0107 and by NSF grant CCR-8900J05.

Morris which makes it possible to keep approximate counts of large numbers in small counters. The algorithm is useful for gathering statistics of a large number of events as well as for applications related to data compression (Todd et al.). We provide here a complete analysis of approximate counting which establishes good convergence properties of the algorithm and allows to quantify precisely complexity-accuracy tradeoffs. Introduction. As shown by an easy information-theoretic argument, maintaining a counter whose values may range in the interval 1 to M essentially necessitates log,M bits. This lower bound is of course achieved by a 1 standard binary counter. R. Morris [8] has proposed a probabilistic algorithm that maintains an approximate count using only about log,log,M bits. This paper is devoted to a detailed analysis of characteristic parameters of that algorithm. We provide precise estimates on the probabilities of errors, from which the soundness of the method can be assessed _and complexity-accuracy trade-offs can be quantified. The algorithm itself is useful for gathering statistics on a large number of events in a storage efficient way [SI. It was proposed for applications to data compression [9] when building an adaptive encoding scheme to represent ~~~~~random\u201d data (see e.g. [4] for adaptive Huffman codes and [7] for arithmetic coding); there, typically a large number of counters need to be maintained to gather statistics on the data to be compressed, but high accuracy of each counter is not a critical factor in the design of almost-optimal codes. Actually Todd et al. report the overall performance of a system using approximate counting which is only 4 few percent off a reference system using exact counts. There are other cases like data base systems where probabilistic counting methods prove useful. We mention a related algorithm; called \u2018\u2018Probabilistic Counting\u201d that has been proposed in [3]. This algorithm makes it possible to determine the approximate value of the number of distinct elements in a file in a single pass using a few operations per element and only O(1) additional storage. Received October 1982. Revised August 1984. 114 PHILIPPE FLAJOLET The plan of the paper is as follows. We start with a simple version of the algorithm: approximate counting with base 2, which is very easy to implement on a binary computer. It appears (Theorems 1, 2) that this algorithm can maintain an approximate count up to M using about log,log,M bits, with an error that is typically of one binary order of magnitude. The analytic techniques that we use in Sections 2, 3, 4, involve manipulation of generating functions related to a discrete time birth-txocess to which the algorithm is equivalent, certain properties of the Mellin integral transform, and finally some simple identities that properly belong to the theory of integer partitions. In Sections 5, 6,.we discuss the more general version of the algorithm with an arbitrary base. The analysis shows that, using suitable corrections, one can count up to M keeping only log, log,M + 6 bits with an accuracy. of order O(2 A preliminary report on this work has been presented at the International Seminar on Modelling and Performance Evaluation Methodology (\u201cOn Approximate Counting\u201d : Proceedings, Volume 2, pp. 205-236, Paris, January 1983). + 1. Approximate counting with a binary base. If the requirement of accuracy is dropped, a counter of value n can be replaced by another counter C containing hog,nJ which only requires storing about log, log, n bits. However since the fractional part of log, n is no longer preserved, there now arises the problem of deciding when to update the logarithmic counter in the course of successive incrementations. The idea of [8], [9] is to base this decision on probabilistic choices. Approximate counting starts with counter C initialized to 1. After n increments, we expect C to contain a good approximation to hog, nJ ; we should thus increase C by 1 after another n increments approximately. Since the exact value of n has not been kept and only C is known, the algorithm has to base its decision on the content of C alone. Approximate counting then treats the incrementation by the following procedure. L. procedure increment (C : integer) ; Let DELTA (C) be ajandorn variable w hkh takes value 1 with probability 2-\u2018 and value 0 wrth probabi */ i tv 1 -2-\u2018; C := C+DELTA (C) The interesting fact about this procedure is the following: if C, is the random variable representing the content of counter C after n applications of the increment procedure, then the expectation of 2 c n bears a simple relation to n (as we shall prove at the end of Section 2).", "references": ["Variations-on-a-theme-by-Huffman-Gallager/65e6ef044d951d2c3cbf7512b6bfa83a8b2b0739"]},

Our probabilistic models assumes that a word is a sequence of Li.d. random variables taking values over a finite alphabet. This defines the so called Bernoulli model. We investigate the length of a subword that can be recopied, that is, such a subword that occurs at least twice in a given word. An occurrence of such repeated substrings is easy to detect in a digital tree called suffix tree. The lengths of repeated substrings correspond to the depths of suffixes stored in the associated suffix tree. Our main finding shows that the depths in a suffix tree are asymptotically distributed in the same manner as the depths in a digital tree that stores independent keys (i.e., independent tries). More precisely, we prove that the depths in a suffix tree built from the first n suffixes of a random word are normally distributed with the mean asymptotically equivalent to 1/hI log n and the variance a \u00b7log n, where hI is the entropy of the alphabet, and a is a parameter of the probabilistic model.

This approach yields naturally the Fourier series involved in the expansions of a variety of digital sums related to number representation systems. Correspondence to: Ph.

Golin"], "date": "1993", "abstract": "The divide-and-conquer principle is a majoi paradigm of algorithms design. Corresponding cost functions satisfy recurrences that directly reflect the decomposition mechanism used in the algorithm. This work shows that periodicity phenomena, often of a fractal nature, are ubiquitous in the performances of these algorithms. Mellin transforms and Dirichlet series are used to attain precise asymptotic estimates. The method is illustrated by a detailed average case, variance and distribution analysis of the classic top-down recursive mergesort algorithm. The approach is applicable to a large number of divide-and-conquer recurrences, and a general theorem is obtained when the partitioningmerging toll of a divide-and-conquer algorithm is a sublinear function. As another illustration the method is also used to provide an exact analysis of an efficient maxima-finding algorithm. Many algorithms are based on a recursive divide-and-conquer strategy. Accordingly, their complexity is expressed by recurrences of the usual divide-andconquer form [10]. Typical examples are heapsort, mergesort, Karatsuba's multiprecision multiplication, discrete Fourier transforms, binomial queues, sorting networks, etc. It is relatively easy to determine general orders of growth for solutions to these recurrences as explained in standard texts, see the \"master theorem\" of [10, p. 62]: if for example In = fin/2j + ffn/21 + en (1) and en = 0(n) then fn = 0(n log n) while if en = 0(72 1 ') for some e > 0 then en = 0(n). However, a precise asymptotic analysis is often appreciably more delicate. At a more detailed level, divide-and-conquer recurrences tend to have solutions that involve periodicities, many of which are of a fractal nature. It is our purpose here to discuss the analysis of such periodicity phenomena while focussing on the analysis of the standard top-down recursive mergesort algorithm. We will show for example that the average number of comparisons performed by mergesort satisfies U(n) = n lg n nB(1g n) 0(n1/2), while the variance is of the form nC(1g n) 0(n' 12 ): B(u) and C(u) are both periodic functions that are fractal-like and which are everywhere continuous but not differentiable at a dense set of points on the line.

Leiserson", "Ronald L. Rivest"], "date": "1989", "abstract": "problems To understand the class of polynomial-time solvable problems, we must first have a formal notion of what a \u201cproblem\u201d is. We define an abstract problem Q to be a binary relation on a set I of problem instances and a set S of problem solutions. For example, an instance for SHORTEST-PATH is a triple consisting of a graph and two vertices. A solution is a sequence of vertices in the graph, with perhaps the empty sequence denoting that no path exists. The problem SHORTEST-PATH itself is the relation that associates each instance of a graph and two vertices with a shortest path in the graph that connects the two vertices. Since shortest paths are not necessarily unique, a given problem instance may have more than one solution. This formulation of an abstract problem is more general than is required for our purposes. As we saw above, the theory of NP-completeness restricts attention to decision problems: those having a yes/no solution. In this case, we can view an abstract decision problem as a function that maps the instance set I to the solution set {0, 1}. For example, a decision problem related to SHORTEST-PATH is the problem PATH that we saw earlier. If i = \u3008G,u, v, k\u3009 is an instance of the decision problem PATH, then PATH(i) = 1 (yes) if a shortest path from u to v has at most k edges, and PATH(i) = 0 (no) otherwise. Many abstract problems are not decision problems, but rather optimization problems, in which some value must be minimized or maximized. As we saw above, however, it is usually a simple matter to recast an optimization problem as a decision problem that is no harder. 1See Hopcroft and Ullman [156] or Lewis and Papadimitriou [204] for a thorough treatment of the Turing-machine model. 34.1 Polynomial time 973", "references": ["Faster-Algorithms-for-the-Shortest-Path-Problem-Ahuja-Mehlhorn/735db80abfa57f2cdafd5236710f3fb1c042be98", "The-Art-of-Computer-Programming%2C-Volume-III%3A-and-Knuth/9a925d73aae2b8c1aa6b4eb2a90d2d93c8d5e3c4", "The-Art-of-Computer-Programming%2C-Volume-I%3A-Knuth/bd3102fa60685380af4c0d9da94237978d40b5bc", "A-Fast-and-Simple-Algorithm-for-the-Maximum-Flow-Ahuja-Orlin/0aca8cd145ac29316e8f0a713b51ad8e820409f2", "The-Input%2FOutput-Complexity-of-Sorting-and-Related-Aggarwal-Vitter/c0d4c5713dba6472edb651334d25c3a5aa78d6f3", "Combinatorial-Optimization%3A-Algorithms-and-Papadimitriou-Steiglitz/1565c128b727550a73bc4e105a3353420112485d", "On-distinguishing-prime-numbers-from-composite-Adleman/8b61888f689060fffd06d7307c6d9490ac7256a9"]},

A radix trie (in short: trie) is such a digital search tree that edges are labelled by elements from aa alphabet (e.g., binary alphabet consisting of O\u2019s and l\u2019s) and leaves (external nodes) contain keys [ 1,4,9]. More precisely, in a binary case a key is a (possible infinite) sequence of O\u2019s and l\u2019s, where 0 means \u201cgo left\u201d and 1 means \u201cgo right\u201d. The keys are stored in external nodes and the access path from the root to a leaf is the minimal prefix information contained in an external node (see Fig. I for an example of a trie). There are a number of applications of tries in computer science and telecommunications, e.g., dynamic hashing, radix exchange sort [4,9], partial match retrieval of muhidimensional data, lexicographical sorting (111, tree-type conflict resolution algorithm for broadcast communications [lo, 141, etc. Two quantities of a digital trie are of special interest: the depth of a leaf and the external path length. The average depth of a leaf has been studied in [3,9], the variance in [6] (binary case) and 1141 (general tries) and higher moments of the depth in [14]. The average value of the external path length is closely related to the average depth of a leaf, but not the variance. The variance of the external path length was never determined up to now, although the external path length finds important applications in practice, e.g., for modified lexicographical sorting [I 11 and for conflict", "references": ["Some-Results-on-V-ary-Asymmetric-Tries-Szpankowski/dbf2cb8a0e2f46b45d61c39fc37b8a262d201690", "Three-Partition-Refinement-Algorithms-Paige-Tarjan/49d629dc59cbce91a105350da5c9a3831bf9c5ba", "Digital-Search-Trees-Revisited-Flajolet-Sedgewick/d8984e89a749bea62f4ad35de12afa70c9b2f905"]},

The bounds hold both in the worst case and in the average case, and in several situations the constant factors match. Secondary storage is modeled as a magnetic disk capable of transferring P blocks each containing B records in a single time unit; the records in each block must be input from or output to B contiguous locations on the disk. We give two optimal algorithms for the problems, which are variants of merge sorting and distribution sorting. In particular we show for P = 1 that the standard merge sorting algorithm is an optimal external sorting method, up to a constant factor in the number of I/Os. Our sorting algorithms use the same number of I/Os as does the permutation phase of key sorting, except when the internal memory size is extremely small, thus affirming the popular adage that key sorting is not faster.

In our second approach, in Section 3, we consider the M/G/\u221e model (which includes M/M/\u221e as a special case) and use techniques from the analysis of algorithms to get optimal big-oh bounds on the expected maximum queue size and on the expected maximum amount of storage used by HwLD in excess of the optimal amount.

Such a compaction can be effected in linear time. It is used to save storage in implementations of functional programming languages, as well as in symbolic manipulation and computer a/gebra systems. In compiling, the compaction problem is known as the \"common subexpression problem\" and it plays a central r61e in register allocation, code generation and optimisation. We establish here that, under a variety of probabilistic models, a tree of size n has a compacted form of expected size asymptotically n C . ogWi' where the constant C is explicitly related to the type of trees to be compacted and to the statistical model reflecting tree usage.

A tree can be compacted by representing occurrences of repeated subtrees only once. In that case, several pointers will point to the representation of any common subtree, and the original tree becomes a directed acyclic digraph also called a dag. The process itself is diversely known as \"sharing\" or \"common subexpression recognition\". Obviously some storage is saved in this way, and our purpose is to estimate the expected gain attained by such a representation. (See Fig. 1.) Trees that we consider are plane rooted trees [21] as commonly occur in a variety of contexts: in Lisp systems or as a representation of expressions in compiling; as syntax trees in parsing and code generation or structured programme editing; as the representation of terms in symbolic manipulation and computer algebra systems. In the programming language Lisp [24], all programmes and data are represented in the form of \"symbolic expressions\" (S-expressions) having a binary branching tree structure. Under the tree representation, the external nodes are labelled with primitive symbols or atoms while the internal nodes, that are unlabelled, only reflect the hierarchical structure of the expression. In most Lisp implementations, external nodes of (S-expression) trees are kept separately, in a storage area called \"atom space\", and multiple instances of them are stored uniquely. This is a restricted form of sharing that presents obvious storage saving advantages. Following an original suggestion by McCarthy, this sharing scheme can also be extended to internal nodes.

It is found that universal (i.e., zero redundancy) coding in a weighted sense is possible if and only if the per-letter average mutual information between the parameter space and the message space is zero.

Many probabilistic properties of elementary discrete combinatorial structures of interest for the average-case analysis of 4gorithms prove to be decidable. This paper presents a general framework in which such decision procedures can be developed. It is based on a combination of generating function techniques for counting, and complex analysis techniques for asymptotic estimations. We expose here the theory of exact analysis in terms of generating functions for four different domains: the iterative/recursive and unlabelled/labelled data type domains. We then present some major components of the associated asymptotic theory and exhibit a class of naturally arising functions that can be automatically analyzed. A fair fragment of this theory is also incorporated into a system called Lambda-Upsilon-Omega. In this way, using computer algebra, one can produce automatically non-trivial average-case analyses of algorithms operating over a variety of \u201cdecomposable\u201d combinatorial structures. At a fundamental level, this paper is part of a global attempt at understanding why so many elementary combinatorial problems tend to have elementary asymptotic solutions. In several cases, it proves possible to relate entire classes of elementary combinatorial problems whose structure is well defined with classes of elementary \u201cspecial\u201d functions and classes of asymptotic forms relative to counting, probabilities, or average-case complexity. This paper presents a systematic framework in which combinatorial enumerations and probabilistic properties of combinatorial structures can be studied formally. The analysis system that we propose is \u201calgebraically complete\u201d with respect to a large category of so-called decomposable data types and their associated 0304-3975!91/$03.50 @ 1991-Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. (North-Holland) 38 P. Flajoiel et al. algorithms. It is also \u201casymptotically complete\u201d with respect to several subclasses of decomposable problems. Thus a number of statistical and computational properties of combinatorial structures can be systematically decided, even in their precise asymptotic form. A correlate of this is the possibility of designing an automatic analyzer of average case performance for several interesting classes of algorithms and programmes. Based on this theory, we have actually built a prototype system called LambdaUpsilon-Omega (A$) that is capable of producing rather non-trivial average-case analyses of algorithms. Here is a small sample of properties amenable to automatic analysis in this context: (i) the average number of cycles in a random permutation of n elements is -log n and the probability that such a permutation has no l-cycle is we-\u2018; (ii) path length in a random heap-ordered tree of n elements is on average -2n log n, which represents also the comparison cost of Quicksort; (iii) path length in a random (uniform) plane tree is -in&; (iv) the symbolic differentiation algorithms of computer algebra gain on average a factor of O(G) if shared representations (i.e., dags) are used, etc. The paper consists of two major parts that reflect the two components of the theory. The first one, the \u201calgebraic\u201d component, deals with exact counting through the algebra of generating functions. The second one, the \u201canalytic\u201d component, uses analytic properties of these generating functions in order to recover relevant asymptotic infcrmations. 1.1. Algebraic enumeration For the class of decomposable combinatorial structures under consideration, i.t is possible to compile automatically structural specifications into equations over counting generating functions. These equations represent in a compact format either explicit or else recursive forms of count sequences. For the associated algorithms, we introduce generating functions of average costs called complexity descriptors, and we provide similar translation mechanisms from programme specifications to these compiexity descriptors. The equations that one generates in this way are meaningful in the sense that all coefficients of generating functions-providing either the number of combinatorial structures of size n or the average case complexity of algorithms over random data of size n -are computable in time that is po!ynomial in n. 1.2. Asymptotic analysis It is known from classical analysis and analytic number theory that the asymptotic growth of coefficients of a series is determined by analytic properties of the series \u2018viewed then as an ;Aytic function of a complex argument). In this domain, singularities and saddle points play an essential role. Automatic average-case analysis of algorithms 39 One of the major benefits of the generating function approach is to associate well identified classes of special functions to well characterized classes of combinatorial structures and programmes. We can then systematically relate classes de3ned by special combinatorial constructions, classes of special functions with specific analytic properties, and asymptotic properties of structures. We first illustrate the principles of our approach by discussing two examples drawn from the classical theory of formal languages and enumerations. Example 1.1 (Regular events andjinite automata). Combinatorial structures defined by regular languages and finite automata have rational generati,ng functions [9,27,71]. The counting sequences accordingly satisfy linear recurrences wulith constant coefficients. From elementary analysis, we know that a rational gcnekating function f(z) admits a partial fraction decomposition, so that its coefficients J, have an explicit form as \u201cexponential polynomials\u201d,", "references": ["Analysis-of-algorithms-and-data-structures-Banachowski-Kreczmar/f84ce0954ce13625cfeba80b5ee81c7c6ae67fa2", "Gaussian-limiting-distributions-for-the-number-of-Flajolet-Soria/b343a94f063069628c44cecf0c05ac673f2b2fe7", "Singularity-Analysis-of-Generating-Functions-Flajolet-Odlyzko/df22d456a21c277ed0d4deef3b7d194fec929657", "Speeding-up-the-computations-on-an-elliptic-curve-Morain-Olivos/07667f65598acaca39675e53a133119264999573", "A-Trivial-Algorithm-Whose-Analysis-is-Not%3A-A-Baeza-Yates/accc1c411989c000d06b1b25ac3770ca04a227dd", "A-logical-approach-to-asymptotic-combinatorics-II%3A-Compton/cea20535dfab32f735c468ce2170f76cb5ef21c2", "Combinatorial-Analysis-of-Quicksort-Algorithm-Hennequin/dd0bfc825d76e9fc5c820cf19c1cf45d2bf1a72c"]},

Because hashing with lazy deletion does not delete items as soon as possible, it keeps more items in the dictionary than methods that use more careful deletion strategies. On the other hand, its space overhead is much smaller than those more careful methods, so if the number of extra items is not too large, hashing with lazy deletion can be a practical algorithm when space is scarce.

The approach yields a very simple algorithm running in O(n 3) time on n-vertex networks. Incorporation of the dynamic tree data structure of Sleator and Tarjan yields a more complicated algorithm with a running time of O(nm log (n 2/m)) on m-edge networks. Ahuja and Orlin developed a variant of Goldberg's algorithm that uses scaling and runs in O(nm + n2 logU) time on networks with integer edge capacities bounded by U. In this paper we obtain a modification of the Ahuja-Orlin algorithm with a running time of O(nm + n2lgU ). We show that the use of dynamic trees in this algorithm reduces the time bound to 0(nm log( n logU + 2)).

Thus splay trees are as efficient as balanced trees when total running time is the measure of interest. In addition, for sufficiently long access sequences, splay trees are as efficient, to within a constant factor, as static optimum search trees. The efficiency of splay trees comes not from an explicit structural constraint, as with balanced trees, but from applying a simple restructuring heuristic, called splaying, whenever the tree is accessed.

This note is based on the observation that it is often useful to associate additional information, with some (relatively few) address locations determined at run time, without the necessity of preallocating the storage at all possible such addresses. That is, it can be useful to have an effective extra bit, field, or address in some words without every word having to contain a bit (or bits) to mark this as a special case. The key idea is that this extra associated information can be found by a table search.

I T e s t i n g P r i m a l i t y : B r i e f R e v i e w Distinguishing prime numbers from composites has intrigued mathemat ic ians as early as about 274 B.C, when the sieve algorithm of Eratosthenes has been allegedly recorded. Much progress has been made on this problem since tile 17th century by Fermat, Euler, Legendre and Gauss. With the arrival of fast computat ional devices new algorithmic ideas based on the work of Fermat and Gauss were proposed and implemented (see [D],[BLS]). These algorithms mostly relied on factoring and thus where impractical for even moderate size inputs. The interest in primality in complexity theory was invoked by the exciting primality tests of Miller[M], Solovay and Srassen [SS], and Rabin [R]. Miller's algorithm [M] is a deterministic polynomial t ime procedure, which when answering \"composite\" gives a proof of correctness, and when answering \"prime\" does not. The assertions of primality made by the algori thm are always correct if if the Extended Riemann Hypothesis (ERH) is true. However, if the ERII is false, the numbers declared prime may still be composite. Thus, tile ERII is not used to bound the running time of the algorithm, but to vouch for the correctness of the answer. The probabilistic primality tests of SolovayStrassen [SS] and Rabin [SS], essentially perform a probabilistic search for a proof of compositeness. The failure of this search, provides circumstantial evidence that the number is not composite. These algorithms always terminate in polynomial time on every input. Upon termination they declare the input either composite or probably prime. When a number is declared \"composite\", a short (verifiable in deterministic polynomial time) proof (certificate) of compositeness is provided. When a number is declared \"probably prime\", then it is a prime with very high probability, but no certainty is provided. The fastest deterministic algorithm known is due to Adleman, Pomerance and Rumley [APR] (followed by Choen-Lenstra[CL]) and runs in time O(kc log los k) on inputs of length k. The answers of this algorithm are always correct. Unfortunately, it is not only slow but, like its predecessors, does do not provide us with a short certificate (i.e polynomial time verifiable proof) of its assertions of primality. As discussed above, finding a short certificate of compositeness can be done quickly probabilistically. But, how about short proofs of primality? Although it is not as obvious as in the case of compositeness, Pra t t [P] has shown that short proofs of primality do exist (i.e the set PRIMES is in NP). Unfortunately, finding a Pratt-certificate for a given prime involves being able to factor quickly, which is hard. Partial progress toward finding short proof of primality quickly was made by Furer IF]. He shows a Las Vegas (always correct, probably fast) algorithm distinguishing between n a product of two primes and the n a prime (provided n ~ 1 mod 24). To summarize, the following questions remain open: \u2022 Is there an infinite set of primes which can be recognized in expected polynomial time ? \u2022 Can random large certified primes be generated in expected polynomial time? \u2022 Is there a probabilistic primality test which is alaways correct and probably fast on every prime input, i.e a Las Vegas primality test ? 1.2 O u r Resul t s In this paper, we propose a probabilistic algorithm which upon termination outputs either \"prime\" or \"composite\", along with a short proof (certificate) of correctness. The proof of correctness can be verified by a deterministic polynomial Lime algorithm. We prove the following. T h e o r e m 1: Given any prime p of length k, our algorithm outputs a certificate of correctness of size O(k2), which can be verified correct in O(k 4) deterministic time. T h e o r e m 3: For every size k ~> 0, our algorithm terminates in expected polynomial time on at least 1 0(2 ' ~ ' ~ ' ~ ) of the prime inputs of length k. Note that the fraction of primes for which we could not prove that the algorithm terminates in expected polynomial time is smaller than any polynomial in k fraction. Let ~(x) denote the number of primes smaller than z. Theorem 2: Our algorithm terminates in expected polynomial time on every input if the following conjecture is true:", "references": []},

Introduction. A fundamental problem in computer science is the so-called dictionary problem, where various operations, chiefly search and insert, are to be performed on a set of records possessing key values. To insert a record is to store it away for later retrieval; to search is to find a previously stored record with a given key value.

Brown", "Robert E. Tarjan"], "date": "1980", "abstract": "In this paper we explore the use of 2-3 trees to represent sorted lists. We analyze the worst-case cost of sequences of insertions and deletions in 2-3 trees under each of the following three assumptions: (i) only insertions are performed; (ii) only deletions are performed; (iii) deletions occur only at the small end of the list and insertions occur only away from the small end. Our analysis leads to a data structure for representing sorted lists when the access pattern exhibits a (perhaps time-varying) locality of reference. This structure has many of the properties of the representation proposed by Guibas, McCreight, Plass and Roberts [A new representation for linear lists, Proc. Ninth Annual Symposium on Theory of Computing, Boulder, CO, 1977, pp. 49-60], but it is substantially simpler and may be practical for lists of moderate size. Key words, analysis of algorithms, deletion, finger, insertion, sorted list, 2-3 tree Introduction. The 2-3 tree [1] is a data structure which allows both fast accessing and fast updating of stored information. For example, 2-3 trees may be used to represent a sorted list of length n so that a search for any item in the list takes O(log n) steps. Once the position to insert a new item or delete an old one has been found (via a search), the insertion or deletion can be performed in O(log n) additional steps. If each insertion or deletion in a 2-3 tree is preceded by a search requiring D.(log n) time, then there is little motivation for improving the above bounds on the worst-case time for insertions and deletions. But there are several applications of 2-3 trees in which the regularity of successive insertions or deletions allows searches to proceed faster than f(log n). One example is the use of a sorted list represented as a 2-3 tree to implement a priority queue [6, p. 152]. In a priority queue, insertions are allowed anywhere, but only the smallest item in the list at any moment can be deleted. Since no searching is ever required to find the next item to delete, an improved bound on the cost of consecutive deletions might lead to a better bound on the cost of the method as a whole. In this paper, we prove several results about the cost of sequences of operations on 2-3 trees. In 1 we derive a bound on the total cost of a sequence of insertions (as a function of the positions of the insertions in the tree) which is tight to within a constant factor. In 2 we derive a similar bound for a sequence of deletions. If the sequence of operations is allowed to include intermixed insertions and deletions, there are cases in which the naive bound cannot be improved: 0(log n) steps per operation may be required. However, we show in 3 that for the priority queue application mentioned above, a mild assumption about the distribution of insertions implies that such bad cases cannot occur. In 4 we explore some consequences of these results. We propose a modification of the basic 2-3 tree structure which allows us to save a finger to an arbitrary position in the tree, with the property that searching d positions away from the finger costs O(log d) steps (independent of the tree size).

Moreover, since an insert operation can exactly invert the effect of a delete operation, and vice versa, a sequence of m inserts and deletes can cause 8 (m logd n) splits and merges. We. present a scheme that reduces the number of splits and merges required to process m inserts and deletes to 0(m), while only modestly increasing the depth of the tree. On the surface it may not seem advantageous to limit the number of splits and merges. Before performing an insert or delete operation, it is generally necessary to perform a tree search involving 8(logd n) nodes. There are situations, however, where the number of splits and merges is the bounding factor in the time to insert and delete. If the application involves locality of reference that is, inserts and deletes tend to occur in close proximity in the tree maintaining \u2018fingers\u2019 that point into the tree can reduce search time substantially below 8(logd n) [2]. Furthermore, searching involves only reading the contents of nodes, while splitting and merging require modifying nodes.

Our algorithms generalize the idea of Flajolet and Martin [2]. who limited themselves to the case d = O. We construct an unbiased estimator of N that is asymptotically optimal (d ...... 00) in the sense that the variance of the estimator is as small as possible. The variance becomes 1/12 = 0.083 as d ...... 00 that is the best possible in a class of counting algorithms investigated in this paper since the correction due to discretization is equal to 1/12 (so called Sheppard's correction), and cannot be beaten by any algorithm within this class. This can be compared to the variance 1.257 of Flajolet and Martin's algorithm. As noted by Brassard and BratIey [1] ''it is far from obvious how to carry out a more precise analysis of the unbiased estimate of N ... \". We present a novel and complete analysis of these new counting algorithms that to the best of our knowledge cannot be obtained by an extension of the analysis in [2].

Moreover, our novel approach is not limited to probabilistic counting algorithms, and it can be applied in the investigation of several other \"splitting algorithms\" such as selecting the loser [15], estimating the number of questions necessary to identify the number of distinct objects [14], searching algorithms based on digital tries, approximate counting, electing d finalists in a contest (d. polling system), and so forth.", "references": ["Estimating-the-multiplicities-of-conflicts-to-speed-Greenberg-Flajolet/2baa9f516ab8a91929af5ea3bcddc310b6fe577c", "Probabilistic-Counting-Algorithms-for-Data-Base-Flajolet-Martin/b36c153be410c0d937d7583de557c0375506d15a", "The-Art-of-Computer-Programming%2C-Volume-III%3A-and-Knuth/9a925d73aae2b8c1aa6b4eb2a90d2d93c8d5e3c4", "Generalized-Digital-Trees-and-Their-Equations-Flajolet-Richmond/1f990c67e5bdf79d5188dec172ef0d4ccead7c99", "Approximate-counting%3A-an-alternative-approach-Kirschenhofer-Prodinger/76d067b331fd76efac096ff35c23721bfb167690", "How-many-random-questions-are-necessary-to-identify-Pittel-Rubin/df66c74b423b8d4423de4cd55a782fbe4551a6a3", "Singularity-Analysis-of-Generating-Functions-Flajolet-Odlyzko/df22d456a21c277ed0d4deef3b7d194fec929657", "Yet-another-application-of-a-binomial-recurrence-Szpankowski-Rego/8140b3c49228b8012f15f3628a48dafa44f95ddd"]},

Ahmed", "Jean-Marc Delosme", "Martin Morf"], "date": "1982", "abstract": "Computational complexity has traditionally been an important measure of the utility of digital signal processing and matrix arithmetic algorithms; however, the digital implementation of such algorithms has often been difficult (or impossible) since they tend to be computebound. Consequently, the quest for real-time processing has resulted in a concerted push for the development of faster computing structures as well as algorithms oflower computational complexity. With the advent of VLSI, many processing elements can now be realized on a single chip, and large collections of processors have therefore become economically feasible. In this article, we present the reader with several highly concurrent, pipelined computing structuresstructures that are realizable in VLSI and that exhibit large throughputs. Although the architectures we describe are introduced through the use of specific examples, they are also applicable to the solution of a variety of other problems. There are three primary reasons why general-purpose uniprocessor computers, especially microcomputers, have met with only limited success in the high-speed signal processing arena. First, they cannot, in general, efficiently compute a variety of elementary operations such as multiplication, vector rotation, and trigonometric functions; these operations are quite common im matrix arithmetic and signal processing algorithms. Second, generalpurpose computer architectures provide only cumbersome address arithmetic for data structures, such as circular buffers, that occur frequently in high-speed signal processing applications (communications, for example). And lastly, with one notable exception, signal processing algorithms exhibit a substantial amount of parallelism that is not effectively exploited in a uniprocessor system. (The exception is the AMD2900 family, which allows some parallelism through the extensive use of two-port RAMs.) Our article will primarily be concerned with architectures that exploit parallelism and that are based on powerful primitive operations. Most signal processing structures, whether parallel or not, tend to emphasize the need for fast multiplication.' However, algorithms for matrix arithmetic and signal processing call for a somewhat larger set of elementary operations: real and complex number multiplications, additions, square roots, divisions, trigonometric functions and their inverses, and, somewhat less often, hyperbolic transformations. For example, the discrete Fourier transform and the matrix decomposition via Givens' rotations demand 2 x 2 plane rotations, while matrix triangular factorization can be performed with 2 x 2 hyperbolic rotations, divisions, and square roots. Multiplications and additions are awkward to use for the generation of these general operations. However, J. E. Volder2 has introduced powerful algorithms named Cordic, for coordinate rotation digital computer, that evaluate a variety of plane coordinate transformations with iterative procedures involving only additions and shift operations at each step, In other words, Cordic processing elements are extremely simple and quite compact to realize, while being no slower than the bit serial multipliers widely proposed for VLSI array structures.3,4 Many of the more complex signal processing tasks and applications, such as statistical analysis and linear and nonlinear programming, rely on standard matrix computations. The basic problem in matrix arithmetic, for which a large number of direct and iterative schemes have been devised, is the solution of linear systems ofequations (and the closely related problem of matrix inversion). A rapid survey of direct methods of solution indicates that Givens' procedure is the method-of-choice from the VLSI implementation standpoint because it can be efficiently", "references": ["Let's-Design-Algorithms-for-VLSI-Systems-Kung/b30ac21647136a449a4ea528ca709b030f988352", "The-CORDIC-Trigonometric-Computing-Technique-Volder/39e2f35889bbf41cb94fddb13595498a33b6d771", "Fourier-Transforms-in-VLSI-Thompson/a749c1deead6e6169af391b7236f449010b29ac3", "A-VLSI-speech-analysis-chip-set-based-on-square-Ahmed-Morf/78f404d162e60704b40671d0daf97a23d4b8bcfd", "Recursive-square-root-ladder-estimation-algorithms-Lee-Morf/6b20db33d2bfe0945a94ae30015852f04dd2f3a9", "VLSI-array-processors-for-signal-processing-Kung/3a6fd3972d741cdfa4ea4961047cd3d9b6e2593e"]},

Its original idea comes from a sequence of terminal symbols of a context-free grammar. It is a promising technique of data compression for ordinary binary-valued pictures such as texts, documents, charts, etc. Fundamental notions like complexity, primitives, simplifications, and other items about binary-valued pictures are introduced at the beginning. A simple context-free grammar G is also introduced. It is shown that every binary-valued picture is interpretable as a terminal sequence of that G. The DF-expression is defined as the reduced terminal sequence of G. It represents the original picture in every detail and contains no surplus data for reproducing it. A quantitative discussion about the total data of a DF-expression leads to the conclusion that any binary-valued picture with complexity less than 0.47 is expressed by the DF-expression with fewer data than the original ones. The coding algorithm of original data into the DF-expression is developed. It is very simple and recursively executable. Experiments were carried out using a PDS (photo digitizing system), where test pictures were texts, charts, diagrams, etc. with 20 cm \u00d7 20 cm size. Data compression techniques in facsimile were also simulated on the same test pictures. Throughout these studies it was made clear that the DF-expression is a very effective technique as a data compression for binary pictorial patterns not only because it yields high data compression but also because its coding and decoding algorithms are very feasible.", "references": []},

Knuth"], "date": "1976", "abstract": "Most of us have gotten accustomed to the idea of using the notation O(f(n)) to stand for any function whose magnitude is upper-bounded by a constant times f(n) , for all large n. Sometimes we also need a corresponding notation for lower-bounded functions, i.e., those functions which are at least as large as a constant times f(n) for all large n. Unfortunately~ people have occasionally been using the O-notation for lower bounds, for example when they reject a particular sorting method \"because its running time is O(n 2) \" I have seen instances of this in print quite of tent and finally it has prompted me to sit down and write a Letter to the Editor about the situation. The classical literature does have a notation for functions that are bounded below, namely ~(f(n)). The most prominent appearance of this notation is in Titchmarsh's magnum opus on Riemann's zeta function [8], where he defines ~(f(n)) on p. 152 and devotes his entire Chapter 8 to \"~-theorems\". See also Karl Prachar's Primzahlverteilung [7], P. 245. The ~ notation has not become very common, although I have noticed its use in a few places, most recently in some Russian publications I consulted about the theory of equidistributed sequences. Once I had suggested to someone in a letter that he use ~-notation \"since it had been used by number theorists for years\"; but later, when challenged to show explicit references, I spent a surprisingly fruitless hour searching in the library without being able to turn up a single reference. I have recently asked several prominent mathematicians if they knew what ~(n 2) meant, and more than half of them had never seen the notation before. Before writing this letter, I decided to search more carefully, and to study the history of O-notation and o-notation as well. Cajori's two-volume work on history of mathematical notations does not mention any of these. While looking for definitions of ~ I came across dozens of books from the early part of this century which defined O and o but not ~ .", "references": []},

Bayesian reconstruction methods overcome this instability by introducing prior information, often in the form of a spatial smoothness regularizer. More elaborate forms of smoothness constraints may be used to extend the role of the prior beyond that of a stabilizer in order to capture actual spatial information about the object. Previously proposed forms of such prior distributions were based on the assumption of a piecewise constant source distribution. Here, the authors propose an extension to a piecewise linear model-the weak plate-which is more expressive than the piecewise constant model. The weak plate prior not only preserves edges but also allows for piecewise ramplike regions in the reconstruction. Indeed, for the authors' application in SPECT, such ramplike regions are observed in ground-truth source distributions in the form of primate autoradiographs of rCBF radionuclides. To incorporate the weak plate prior in a MAP approach, the authors model the prior as a Gibbs distribution and use a GEM formulation for the optimization. They compare quantitative performance of the ML-EM algorithm, a GEM algorithm with a prior favoring piecewise constant regions, and a GEM algorithm with their weak plate prior. Pointwise and regional bias and variance of ensemble image reconstructions are used as indications of image quality. The authors' results show that the weak plate and membrane priors exhibit improved bias and variance relative to ML-EM techniques.", "references": ["Visual-Reconstruction-Blake-Zisserman/048e3a0904f7d964a0ade5da031a585dadc5a92f", "On-the-Statistical-Analysis-of-Dirty-Pictures-By-Besag/47865b56fee61d9c9ff477f7c79f090cc6663d3a", "Stochastic-Relaxation%2C-Gibbs-Distributions%2C-and-the-Geman-Geman/2408a19a13fcd4f76b2fe0b5d654fe5c276e6f0e", "Using-Ground-truth-Data-to-Design-Priors-in-Spect-Lee-Gindi/2325b8b679e04299bd1313afb08b79dd8a6233a8", "Bayesian-Reconstruction-for-Emissiom-Tomography-via-Gindi-Rangarajan/2890d246974b3360c17afed8924722ca2916fffe"]},

The saddle-point paradigm of mean-field methods in statistical physics provides a systematic procedure for finding such a mapping via the notion of effective energy. Specifically, it is shown that within this paradigm, to each closed bounded constraint set is associated a smooth convex potential function. Using the conjugate (or the Legendre-Fenchel transform) of the convex potential, the effective energy can be transformed to yield a cost function that is a natural generalization of the analog Hopfield energy. Descent dynamics and deterministic annealing can then be used to find the global minimum of the original minimization problem. When the conjugate is hard to compute explicitly, it is shown that a minimax dynamics, similar to that of Arrow and Hurwicz in Lagrangian optimization, can be used to find the saddle points of the effective energy. As an illustration of its wide applicability, the effective energy framework is used to derive Hopfield-like energy functions and descent dynamics for two classes of networks previously considered in the literature, winner-take-all networks and rotor networks, even when the cost function of the original optimization problem is not quadratic.", "references": ["Constrained-Nets-for-Graph-Matching-and-Other-Simic/79ec67bbbcea16a55afeb7ca782cbd7672f3bd9f", "Parallel-and-Deterministic-Algorithms-from-MRFs%3A-Geiger-Girosi/327e432319dcb59ba322a9202231d37b7633a7e4", "Statistical-Physics-Algorithms-That-Converge-Yuille-Kosowsky/ed223a6a3f853a6720406d6c22680e02e3953b9c", "On-Deriving-Deterministic-Learning-Rules-from-Meir/dcd9a79561e37773f1d007ff118162095793477f", "The-invisible-hand-algorithm%3A-Solving-the-problem-Kosowsky-Yuille/429b1cf154d3d5e24d98b6d83f875cd91aab72fd", "Analog-neural-networks-with-local-competition.-I.-Waugh-Westervelt/a844130b1f8693d6e5b11af88094039e136bc7f5", "Mean-field-phase-transitions-and-correlation-for-Elfadel-Yuille/31652b1fcd467e4fd23dc64624d537c02ab367de", "The-Softmax-Nonlinearity%3A-Derivation-Using-and-as-a-Elfadel-Wyatt/e638882c232350afa5f2ab1249fc107a05d13898"]},

Besides their interesting connections to stability and scattering theory, partial correlations and matrix square-roots, they also seem to have well behaved numerical properties. Ladder forms seem to be a \"natural\" form for Wiener (or whitening) filters due to the fact that the optimal whitening filter is time-varying (even for stationary processes), except for ladder form coefficients, which are constants \"switched on\" at the appropriate time. This leads to the fact that this parametrization is very well suited for tracking rapidly varying sources. Compared to gradient type techniques, our exact least-squares ladder recursions have only a slightly increased number of operations. This increase is due to the recursively computed likelihood variables which act as optimal gains on the data, enabling the ladder filter to lock rapidly on to a transient. Several ladder form applications will be briefly discussed, such as speech modeling, \"zero startup\" equalisers, and \"noise cancelling and inversion\".

Where appropriate, we also relate these parallel compiler optimizations to those used in standard compilers.", "references": ["A-Vectorizing-Fortran-Compiler-Scarborough-Kolsky/85df9f0cbc1fa77d0b61c223c8ad09c33913e376", "Compiler-Generated-Synchronization-for-Do-Loops-Midkiff-Padua/3f88bb0f4959de1cdbfb7fcbf6d5646b522310c1", "Direct-parallelization-of-call-statements-Triolet-Irigoin/8b4fdcd9f225516ef54f87307876d949e7043662", "Doacross%3A-Beyond-Vectorization-for-Multiprocessors-Cytron/ddc1d7b5bffff2a2579b1aca74cb9b6f69a1f0e2", "Interprocedural-constant-propagation-Callahan-Cooper/20c843dfecb02cb731e89cfa9b626a604afde93f", "Interprocedural-dependence-analysis-and-Burke-Cytron/074fe836226046592a4f2f35bad6be922f14186d", "Parallel-supercomputing-today-and-the-cedar-Kuck-Davidson/fa5cc2fb23859d8153e697d1e6e69d230c6cb0f8"]},

The main point of the elastic net algorithm is seen to be in the way one deals with the constraints when evaluating the effective cost function (free energy in the thermodynamic analogy), and not in its geometric foundation emphasized originally by Durbin and Willshaw. As a consequence, the elastic net algorithm is a special case of the more general physically based computations and can be generalized to a large class of nongeometric problems. In this paper we further elaborate on this observation, and generalize the elastic net to the quadratic assignment problem. We work out in detail its special case, the graph matching problem, because it is an important problem with many applications in computational vision and neural modeling.

The Bayes smoothing algorithm yields the a posteriori distribution of the scene value at each pixel, given the total noisy image, in a recursive way. The a posteriori distribution together with a criterion of optimality then determine a Bayes estimate of the scene. The algorithm presented is an extension of a 1-D Bayes smoothing algorithm to 2-D and it gives the optimum Bayes estimate for the scene value at each pixel. Computational concerns in 2-D, however, necessitate certain simplifying assumptions on the model and approximations on the implementation of the algorithm. In particular, the scene (noiseless image) is modeled as a Markov mesh random field, a special class of Markov random fields, and the Bayes smoothing algorithm is applied on overlapping strips (horizontal/vertical) of the image consisting of several rows (columns). It is assumed that the signal (scene values) vector sequence along the strip is a vector Markov chain. Since signal correlation in one of the dimensions is not fully used along the edges of the strip, estimates are generated only along the middle sections of the strips. The overlapping strips are chosen such that the union of the middle sections of the strips gives the whole image. The Bayes smoothing algorithm presented here is valid for scene random fields consisting of multilevel (discrete) or continuous random variables.", "references": ["Estimation-and-choice-of-neighbors-in-models-of-Kashyap-Chellappa/57f026193d152116936a5d0c99ab29ccf77d483c", "Advances-in-mathematical-models-for-image-Jain/6709c3dc2008bdd99686da6a7b5f10c14596379f"]},

In this paper we concentrate on developing a general deterministic theory for the study of phase transitions when a single parameter, namely, the temperature, is varied. This deterministic framework is based on a technique known as themean-field approximation, which is widely used in statistical physics. Our mean-field theory is general in that it is valid for any number of gray levels, any pairwise interaction potential, any neighborhood structure or size, and any set of constraints imposed on the desired images. The mean-field approximation is used to compute closed-form estimates of the critical temperatures at which phase transitions occur for two texture models widely used in the image modeling literature: the Potts model and the autobinomial model. The mean-field model allows us to gain insight into the Gibbs model behavior in the neighborhood of these temperatures. These analytical results are verified by computer simulations that use a novel mean-field descent algorithm. An important spinoff of our mean-field theory is that it allows us to compute approximations for the correlation functions of GRF models, thus bridging the gap between neighborhood-based and correlation-baseda priori image models.", "references": ["Markov-Random-Field-Texture-Models-Cross-Jain/7862fc4099b31f0a21fcf681403c2e594c2dd5bc", "Mean-field-annealing%3A-A-formalism-for-constructing-Bilbro-Snyder/c5d073f9ea3b5f8d8a135c42241e06a6721ea7fa", "Mean-field-annealing%3A-a-formalism-for-constructing-Bilbro-Snyder/d167aebee059af30f4ed0482bfca1679c904d655", "Structure-of-aura-and-co-occurrence-matrices-for-Picard-Elfadel/20909cdecc771ba09f34f8dc932dfb1440199759", "A-common-framework-for-image-segmentation-Geiger-Yuille/d1a636654dea9109946c06da03735d87c2c561f9", "Markov%2Fgibbs-Modeling%3A-Texture-and-Temperature-Picard-Pentland/ef9003504a9bf76629bb8a581f994953b1f04926", "Nonlinear-analog-networks-for-image-smoothing-and-Lumsdaine-Wyatt/2fe47dc9fe110641b701a93de0498603eec26d49", "Parallel-and-Deterministic-Algorithms-from-MRFs%3A-Geiger-Girosi/327e432319dcb59ba322a9202231d37b7633a7e4"]},

The dendritic trees of alpha-cells are unistratified in either of two laminae within the inner plexiform layer. This stratification difference was shown physiologically to correspond to the on-off dichotomy. For all alpha-cells recorded, the dendritic field was covered by the corresponding receptive field centre. In addition the general shape of the receptive field centre corresponded to the shape of the dendritic field. The size of the dendritic tree was always smaller than the receptive field centre. The topographical distribution of on- and off-alpha cells could be studied. They were found to occur in about equal numbers. Both on- and off-alpha-cell perikarya form a regular lattice and both lattices are superimposed independently. The dendritic branches of neighbouring alpha-cells overlap and each retinal point is covered by the dendritic field of at least one on- and one off-alpha-cell. After horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injection into the lateral geniculate nucleus all beta-cells were labelled. In this way it is shown that about 55% of all ganglion cells are beta-cells. The mosaic of on- and off-beta-cells was studied from the HRP-labelled material. It is commonly assumed that beta-cells are associated with the resolution of fine detail in the cat visual system. The mosaic of beta-cells imposes some constraints and permits some predictions to be made with respect to the cat's visual discrimination.", "references": []},

In an explicit masking paradigm, vernier acuity for a sine wave grating was found to be adversely affected by the presence of a masking grating falling within a critical band of frequencies near the test target. In the sampled stimulus, removal of sampling replicas similar in frequency to the test improved acuity, but the extent of the residual interference by high frequency components could not be predicted from the masking data. The high frequency interference effect depended on fixed phase relations between frequency components, creating narrow bright bars in the spatial luminance profile, and was greatly reduced by phase randomizing the sampling replicas.

Tuning surfaces of contrast threshold elevation induced by a sinusoidal mask were generated for four Subjects, interpolated from an 11 X 11 Cartesian grid over the Fourier plane, and numerically Fourier transformed in two dimensions to infer putative filter profiles in the 2D space domain. Among the main findings in the 2D frequency domain were: (1) Threshold elevation surfaces are highly polar nonseparable--they cannot be described as the product of a spatial frequency tuning curve times an orientation tuning curve. (2) Iso-half-amplitude contours of the spectral tuning surfaces have a length/width elongation ratio of about 2:1. (3) Necessarily, resolution for spatial frequency and for orientation are in fundamental competition with 2D spatial resolution. By calculating the occupied area of the inferred filters both in the 2D space domain and in the 2D frequency domain, it was estimated that these mechanisms approach within a factor of 2.5 of the theoretical limit of joint resolution in the two 2D domains that can be derived by 2D generalization of Gabor's famous Theory of Communication (1946). Other classes of 2D filters, such as an ideal 2D bandpass filter, have joint 2D entropies which are suboptimal by a factor of 13 or more. Subject to the inherent constraints on inference from these 2D masking experiments, the evidence suggests that 2D spatial frequency channels can be described as elongated 2D spatial wave-packets which crudely resemble optimal forms for joint information resolution in the 2D spatial and 2D frequency domains.", "references": []},

We derive this structure by characterizing configurations of the distribution that are most likely to be synthesized when the Gibbs energy is minimized. This minimization is an important part of applications that use the Gibbs model within a Bayesian estimation framework for maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. In particular, we show that the aura matrix will become tridiagonal for an attractive autobinomial field when suitable constraints exist on the histogram, neighborhood, and image sizes. Under the same constraints, but where the field is repulsive instead of attractive, the matrix will become antitridiagonal.

Frequently, processes are needed which reduce ambiguity and noise, and select the best label among several possible choices. Relaxation labeling processes are just such a class of algorithms. They are based on the parallel use of local constraints between labels. This paper develops a theory to characterize the goal of relaxation labeling. The theory is founded on a definition of con-sistency in labelings, extending the notion of constraint satisfaction. In certain restricted circumstances, an explicit functional exists that can be maximized to guide the search for consistent labelings. This functional is used to derive a new relaxation labeling operator. When the restrictions are not satisfied, the theory relies on variational cal-culus. It is shown that the problem of finding consistent labelings is equivalent to solving a variational inequality. A procedure nearly identical to the relaxation operator derived under restricted circum-stances serves in the more general setting. Further, a local convergence result is established for this operator. The standard relaxation labeling formulas are shown to approximate our new operator, which leads us to conjecture that successful applications of the standard methods are explainable by the theory developed here.

This paper explores the hypothesis that an important part of the cortex can be modeled as a connectionist computer that is especially suited for parallel problem solving. The connectionist computer uses a special representation, termed value unit encoding, that represents small subsets of parameters in a way that allows parallel access to many different parameter values.

There is an alternate approach where the texture surface is transformed as a 2-D image until it conforms to a projection of a polygon placed arbitrarily in 3-space. The great advantage of this approach is that the 2-D transformation can be decomposed into two simple transforms, one in horizontal and the other in vertical scanline order. horizontal scanline order, Sophisticated light calculation is also time consuming and difficult to calculate correctly on projected polygons. Instead of calculating the lighting based on the position of the polygon, lights, and eye, the lights and eye can be transformed to a corresponding position for a unit square which we can consider to be a canonical polygon. After this canonical polygon is correctly textured and shaded it can be easily conformed to the projection of the 3-D surface.", "references": []},

A systematic study of the positional selectivity of visual fixation (VF) neurons of the posterior parietal association cortex (area 7a or PG) was made in seven hemispheres of four alert behaving monkeys. By gaze fixation on a small spot of light in space, 125 units were identified as VF neurons. the position of the fixation target was varied not only in the frontal plane, but also in depth. 2. Microelectrode penetrations were made in the anterior and posterior part of area 7a. The recording sites of 104 VF neurons, determined histologically, were distributed mainly in the posterior part: the caudal part of the posterior bank of the intraparietal sulcus and the caudal third of the anterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus. The following conclusions are based mainly on the observations of the VF neurons in the posterior part of area 7a. 3. Most of the VF neurons examined in the frontal plane (86/93) had a preferred direction of gaze along the horizontal (39/86), vertical (38/86), or diagonal axis (9/86), and their discharge rates were monotonic increasing functions of the angle of deviation from the center. 4. Many VF neurons had selectivity in the depth of fixation. The majority (41/63) were activated more intensely when the fixation point was nearer to the animal (less than 50 cm), whereas a considerable number (18/63) were activated better when the fixation point was further from the animal (100 cm or more). There were a few units (4/63) that discharged maximally at intermediate distances. 5. Thirty-two VF neurons were studied in detail along all three axes: vertical, horizontal, and depth. About half of them (17/32) were found to be selective both in the radial direction and the distance of fixation, while the others displayed selectivity in the direction of gaze alone (11/32) or in depth alone (4/32). 6. The activity of VF neurosis in the dark was compared to that in a lighted room in order to examine their relationship to eye position in detail. Half of the VF neurons tested (25/50) showed almost the same discharge rate in the dark as in the lighted room in spite of the absence of visual stimuli other than the target light in the fovea. Moreover, the discharge rate of the majority of these VF neurons displayed a close correlation with eye position, even in complete darkness. On the other hand nearly half of the VF neurons (22/50) showed a decrease in discharge rate in the dark during fixation at preferred positions suggesting that visual stimuli in the surroundings have some excitatory effects on these neurons. There were also some VF neurons whose activity decreased when the target light was interrputed. Even in such visually sensitive VF neurons, their positional selectivity depended mainly on eye position. 7...", "references": []},

We cast this task as a restoration problem: Given a measurement g(z, y), we assume that g(z, y) resulted from the addition of noise to some \"ideal\" image fez, y) which we must estimate from three things:", "references": ["On-the-Statistical-Analysis-of-Dirty-Pictures-By-Besag/47865b56fee61d9c9ff477f7c79f090cc6663d3a", "Field-theoretical-approach-to-critical-phenomena.-Bagnuls-Bervillier/edb8cc7122c0ed739ba988b59f93a3b99d0ef2e3", "Image-restoration-using-a-neural-network-Zhou-Chellappa/20d85980aaedd9720c40ef27c0136c10d108b66f", "Segmentation-through-Variable-Order-Surface-Fitting-Besl-Jain/9cb0b37ade76ffb299f6d103203e246d058a6d8c"]},

The results show the algorithm to be inferior to several well-known heuristics in terms of both solution quality and computer time expended.

A relaxation process can be used to reduce these errors; we classify the pixels probabilistically, and then adjust the probabilities for each pixel, based on its neighbors' probabilities, with light reinforcing light and dark dark.

Solving the segmentation problem requires a mechanism for partitioning the image array into low-level entities based on a model of the underlying image structure. Using a piecewise-smooth surface model for image data that possesses surface coherence properties, we have developed an algorithm that simultaneously segments a large class of images into regions of arbitrary shape and approximates image data with bivariate functions so that it is possible to compute a complete, noiseless image reconstruction based on the extracted functions and regions.

A neural network model is employed to represent a possibly nonstationary image whose gray level function is the simple sum of the neuron state variables. The restoration procedure consists of two stages: estimation of the parameters of the neural network model and reconstruction of images. During the first stage, the parameters are estimated by comparing the energy function of the network to a constrained error function. The nonlinear restoration method is then carried out iteratively in the second stage by using a dynamic algorithm to minimize the energy function of the network. Owing to the model\u2019s fault-tolerant nature and computation capability, a high-quality image is obtained using this approach. A practical algorithm with reduced computational complexity is also presented. Several computer simulation examples involving synthetic and real images are given to illustrate the usefulness of our method. The choice of the boundary values to reduce the ringing effect is discussed, and comparisons to other restoration methods such as the SVD pseudoinverse filter, minimum mean-square error (MMSE) filter, and modified MMSE filter using the Gaussian Markov random field model are given.

In this article we develop a similar adaptive element, but one which is more closely in accord with the facts of animal learning theory than elements commonly studied in adaptive network research. We suggest that an essential feature of classical conditioning that has been largely overlooked by adaptive network theorists is its predictive nature. The adaptive element we present learns to increase its response rate in anticipation of increased stimulation, producing a conditioned response before the occurrence of the unconditioned stimulus. The element also is in strong agreement with the behavioral data regarding the effects of stimulus context, since it is a temporally refined extension of the Rescorla-Wagner model. We show by computer simulation that the element becomes sensitive to the most reliable, nonredundant, and earliest predictors of reinforcement. We also point out that the model solves many of the stability and saturation problems encountered in network simulations.

PEOPLE LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE, and for the past 25 years, Artificial Intelligence researchers have been attempting to replicate this process. In t,his article we focus on learning in domains where search is involved. Furthermore, we will restrict our attention t,o cases in which the legal operators for a task are known, and the learning task is to determine the conditions under which those operators can be usefully applied. Once such a set of heuristically useful conditions has been discovered, search will be directed down profitable paths, and thus greatly reduced. In the following section we will examine four systems that learn useful conditions on operators by examining solution paths. We shall see that this process can be divided into three components. Firstly, one must be able to find one or more solution paths to the goal state. Secondly, one must be able to assign credit when a correct operator is used and assign blame when an incorrect operator is selected. Thirdly, one must, be able to modify the responsible operators to reinforce positive behavior and to prevent errors in the future.

Parallelism, rather than raw speed of the computing elements. seems to be the way that the brain gets such jobs done. But even if the need for massive parallelism is admitted, there is still the question of what kind of parallel architecture best fits the needs of various A1 tasks. In this paper we will attempt to isolate a number of basic computational tasks that an intelligent system must perform. We will describe several families of massively parallel computing architectures, and we will see which of these computational tasks can be handled by each of these families. In particular, we will describe a new architecture, which we call the Boltzmann machine, whose abilities appear to include a number of tasks that are inefficient or impossible on the other architectures. FAMILIES OF PARALLEL ARCHITECTURES By \"massively parallel\" architectures, we mean machines with a very large number of processing elements (perhaps very simple ones) working on a single task. A massively parallel system may be complete and self-contained or it may be a special-purpose device, performing some particular taqk as part of a larger system that contains other modules of a different character. In this paper we will focus on the computation performed by a single parallel module, ignoring the issue of how to integrate a collection of modules into a complete system. One usehl way of classifying these massively parallel architectures is by the type of signal that is passed among the elements. Fahlman (1982) proposes a division of these systems into three classes: marker-passing, value-passing, and message-passing systems. Message-passing systems are the most powerful family, and by far the most complex. They pass around messages of arbitrary complexity, and perform complex operations on these messages. Such generality has its price: the individual computing elements are complex, the communication costs are high, and there may be severe contention and traffic congestion problems in the network. Message passing does not seem plausible as a detailed model of I processing in the brain. Such models are being actively studied elsewhere (Hillis, 1981; Hewitt, 1980) and we have nothing more to say about them here. ,.

An attractive property of rclaxation methods is that they can be implemented in parallel hardwarc where one computational unit is used for each possible hypothcsis, and the interactions betwcen hypotheses are implemented by dircct hardwarc connections betwcen the units.

Tyler"], "date": "1980", "abstract": "The word-by-word time-course of spoken language understanding was investigated in two experiments, focussing simultaneously on word-recognition (local) processes and on structural and interpretative (global) processes. Both experiments used three word-monitoring tasks, which varied the description under which the word-target was monitored for (phonetic, semantic, or both) and three different prose contexts (normal, semantically anomalous, and scrambled), as well as distributing word-targets across nine word-positions in the test-sentences. The presence or absence of a context sentence, varied across the two experiments, allowed an estimate of between-sentence effects on local and global processes. The combined results, presenting a detailed picture of the temporal structuring of these various processes, provided evidence for an on-line interactive language processing theory, in which lexical, structural (syntactic), and interpretative knowledge sources communicate and interact during processing in an optimally efficient and accurate manner. Spoken language understanding is, above all, an activity that takes place rapidly in time. The listener hears a series of transient acoustic events, that normally will not be repeated, and to which he must assign an immediate interpretation. These interpretative operations are rather poorly understood, and very little is known about the detailed structure of their organization in time. *The experiments and the original data analyses were carried out while both authors were attached to the Committee on Cognition and Communication at the University of Chicago, and was supported by a grant to WMW from the Spencer Foundation.

Synaptic activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors on these sympathetic neurons results in the generation of a slow EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential), which is accompanied by a decrease in membrane conductance. We found that the conventional \"fast\" EPSPs were increased in amplitude and duration during the iontophoretic application of methacholine, which activates the muscarinic postsynaptic receptors. A similar result was obtained when a noncholinergic conductance-decrease PSP--the late-slow EPSP--was elicited by stimulation of a separate synaptic pathway. The enhancement of fast EPSP amplitude increased the probability of postsynaptic action potential generation, thus increasing the efficacy of impulse transmission across the synapse. Stimulation of one synaptic pathway is therefore capable of increasing the efficacy of synaptic transmission in a second synaptic pathway by a postsynaptic mechanism. Furthermore, this enhancement of synaptic efficacy is long-lasting by virtue of the long duration of the slow PSP. Biochemical and electrophysiological techniques were used to investigate whether cyclic nucleotides are intracellular second messengers mediating the membrane permeability changes underlying slow-PSP generation. Stimulation of the synaptic inputs, which lead to the generation of the slow-PSPs, increased the ganglionic content of both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. However, electrophysiological analysis of the actions of these cyclic nucleotides and the actions of agents that affect their metabolism does not provide support for such a second messenger role for either cyclic nucleotide.", "references": []},

A neurophysiological model is described which demonstrates the capacity to l e a r n , to generalize, to compute multivariate mathematical functions, and to decompose input commands into sequences of output commands in a context-sensitivemanner. Evidence is presented that clusters of neurons with such properties are arranged in hierarchical structures in the brain so as to produce AND/OR task compositions. At the lowest levels in the motor system these clusters transform coordinates and compute servo functions. At the middle levels they decompose input commands into sequences of output commands which give rise to behavior patterns. Mechanisms by which feedback can alter these decomposition sequences to compensate for perturbations and uncertainties in the environment are described. At the highest levels of the hierarchy there are goal selecting and evaluating mechanisms. I t is argued that in higher mammals these upper levels of the motor hierarchy are the mechanisms of planning and problem solving. PREFACE The following paper attempts as far as possible to present a notation which i s both intuitively clear and mathematically precise, and to offer supporting evidence wherever possible.

The assumption, unchallenged for many years, that PSG's were inadequate for natural languages is based on arguments originally advanced by transformational linguists in the late 1950\u00bbs and early 1960's. but recent work has shown that none of those arguments were valid. The present paper draws on that work to argue that (i) there is no reason, at the present time, to think that natural languages are not context-free languages, (ii) there are good reasons to think that the notations needed to capture significant syntactic generalizations will characterize phrase structure grammars or some minor generalization of them, and (iii) there are good reasons for believing that such grammars, and the monostratal representations they induce, provide the necessary basis for the semantic interpretation of natural languages. If these arguments are valid, then the prospects for a fruitful interaction between theoretical linguistics and AI are much brighter than they would otherwise be. I INTRODUCTION Consider the following quotations: As already mentioned, a context-free phrase structure grammar is not sufficient to describe or analyze the whole range of syntactic constructions which occur in natural language texts (cf. Chomsky 1957). Even if one disregards the theoretical linguist's demand for satisfactory descriptions of the syntactic structure of sentences, there are strong reasons to design a more powerful parser than the one described above. Cases in point are the phenomenon of agreement within noun phrases, the correspondence in the verb phrase between the form of the main verb and the type of the auxiliary, and subject verb agreement. The argument structure of predicates, that is, their various types of objects and complements, represents another kind of context-sensitivity in natural language. ... The best strategy seems to be to take care of the particular types of context-sensitivity recognized by linguistic theory by means of special procedures which act as a superstructure of the algorithm for context-free analysis. ... In addition to the above-mentioned drawbacks a context-free phrase structure grammar has difficulty handling word order variation in a natural way. One significant-use of the general context-free methods is as part \u2026", "references": []},

The fuillctional unit of cognitive coding is suggested to be an adaptive resonance, or amplification and ,prolongation of neural activity, that occurs when afferent data and efferent expectancies reach consensus through a matching process. The resonant state embodies the perceptual event, or attentional focus, and its amplified and sustained activities are capable of driving slow changes of long-term memor:r\"' Mismatch between afferent data and efferent expectancies yields a global sulppression of activity and triggers a reset of short-term memory, as well as raJ~id parallel search and hypothesis testing for uncommitted cells.

The current research was directed at discovering the psychologically relevant properties of this structure. Two fundamental descriptions were independently varied in the construction of six-letter nonword strings. A probabilistic description based on the frequency of occurrence of letters in each position was factorially combined with a rule-governed description defined in terms of graphemic and phonological constraints. College sophomores and sixth-grade readers were asked to indicate whether or not a predesignated target letter was present in these strings. For both groups of readers, orthographic regularity and summed positional frequency were found to have only a small facilitative effect on reaction time (RT). In contrast, RTs to say \"no\" increased dramatically with increases in the number of letters in the catch string that were physically similar to the target letter. In another experiment, the letter string was presented for a short duration, followed immediately by masking stimulus and then the target letter. College students indicated whether or not the target was present in the test string. Accuracy of performance was critically dependent on the orthographic regularity and summed positional frequencies of the letters in the test string. No effect of letter similarity was observed. The large differences that were observed between these two tasks were accounted for in terms of the stages of processing that are critical for performance in the tasks.", "references": []},

McClelland"], "date": "1979", "abstract": "This article examines the possibility that the components of an informationprocessing system all operate continuously, passing information from one to the next as it becomes available. A model called the cascade model is presented and it is shown to be compatible with the general form of the relation between time and accuracy in speed-accuracy trade-off experiments. In the model , experimentlLlmanipulations may have either or both of two effects on a processing level: They may alter the rate of response or the asymptotic quality pf the output. The effects of such manipulations on the output of a system of proessesare described. The model is then used to reexamine, the subtraction and additive factors methods for analyzing the composition of systems of processes. The examination of the additive factors method yields particularly interesting results. Among them is the finding that factors that affect the rates of two different processes would be expected to have additive effects on reaction times under the cascade model, whereas factors that both affect the rate of the same process would tend to interact, just as in the case in which the manipulations affect the durations of discrete stages. On the other hand, factors that affect asymptotic output tend to interact whether they affect the same or different processes. In light of this observation, the conclusions drawn from several studies about the locus of perceptual and attentional effects on processing are reexamined. Finally, an outline is presented of a new method for analyzing processes in cascade. The method extends the additive factors method to an analysis of the parameters of the function relating response time and accuracy.", "references": ["A-Theory-of-Memory-Retrieval-Ratcliff/bccf38995692eae3f555e91093e31f9b0199d040", "List-length-and-the-time-course-of-recognition-in-Reed/04a8914c1c38a617332ca291271a765e76e9f8a7"]},

Motor learning in the cerebellar cortex is treated as a problem of covariance storage, and a predicition is made for the underlying synaptic plasticity: the change in synaptic strength between a parallel fiber and a Purkinje cell should be proportional to the covariance between discharges in the parallel fiber and the climbing fiber.

The matching is a specification of the geometrical disparity between the images and may be used to partially reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of the scene. Sets of candidate matching points are selected independently in each image. These points are the locations of small, distinct features which are likely to be detectable in both images. An initial network of possible matches between the two sets of candidates is constructed. Each possible match specifies a possible disparity of a candidate point in a selected reference image. An initial estimate of the probability of each possible disparity is made, based on the similarity of subimages surrounding the points. These estimates are iteratively improved by a relaxation labeling technique making use of the local continuity property of disparity that is a consequence of the continuity of real world surfaces. The algorithm is effective for binocular parallax, motion parallax, and object motion. It quickly converges to good estimates of disparity, which reflect the spatial organization of the scene.", "references": ["Foundations-of-cyclopean-vision-Julesz/89ffb32150be3e0ad67acba57b2726770467c6be"]},

Feldman"], "date": "1972", "abstract": "The grammatical inference problem is easy to state: One must choose, on the basis of a finite set of symbol strings, a grammar for the language of which the given set is a sample. Precisely the same problem arises in trying to choose a model (theory, function, etc.) to explain a collection of sample data. This is one of the most important information processing problems known and it is surprising that there has been so little work on its formalization. The papers that have been written (e.g., Solomonoff, 1964) all discuss the importance of the problem so we will forego that discussion here. Any attempt to formalize the grammatical inference problem must include precise formulations of several concepts left vague in the statement above. The four central notions are: the hypothesis space, the measure of adequacy, the rules by which samples are drawn, and the criterion for success in the limit of the inference process. For this paper, the hypothesis spaces will be subsets of the general rewriting systems expressed in a particular notation. A grammar will adequately represent a sample when it generates all of the known strings and none of the non-strings of the sample; in Section 3 we introduce an additional requirement of minimum complexity. For the presentation of sample strings, we require only that each string ultimately be included, (Horning, 1969) makes use of stronger requirements.

A. Robinson"], "date": "1976", "abstract": "1. The gain of the vestibuloocular reflex (slow-phase eye velocity/head velocity) was measured in 17 adult cats. 2. The gain of the reflex, in the dark, was 0.90 (+/-0.15 SD) over the frequency range 0.03-1.2 Hz. 3. In the range 0.01-0.15 Hz, the phase behaved as though the overall reflex time constant were 12 s or greater. The cupula time constant is 4 s. Therefore, the central part of the reflex must manipulate the canal signal to improve its low-frequency response by a factor of at least three. 4. When the cats wore left-right reversing prisms chronically and were also rotated for 2 h every day, the reflex underwent large, plastic changes. The gain, tested in the dark, decreased by 93% at 0.05 Hz and 55% at 1.2 Hz. In effect, the low-frequency response was abolished. The process took about 8 days. 5. In the light, with reversed vision, the gain decreased further and, at low frequencies, the eye movements did reverse in direction. 6. When the vestibulocerebellum was removed, the gain, in the dark, rose to about 1.17 and the plastic changes caused by reversing prisms were completely abolished. 7. Reversing prisms create vestibuloocular dysmetria. The change in gain they produce is considered to be an adaptive response designed to reduce image motion on the retina during head movements. The vestibulocerebellum is necessary for this adaptive process. It is proposed that detecting and repairing dysmetria (of natural origin) is an important cerebellar function.", "references": []},

Cross-correlograms, response planes, and a new function, the logical response plane, were calculated. The cross-correlograms between these pairs revealed four interactive classes: 1) a class with a flat cross-correlogram, 2) a class with a peak in the center of the cross-correlogram seen both during spontaneous activity and during driven activity, 3) a class with an inhibitory dip in the center of the cross-correlogram seen only when the cell pairs were driven by a stimulus and predicted by the shift predictor, 4) finally, a class with an inhibitory dip in the center of the cross-correlogram seen both during driven activity and spontaneous activity and not predicted by the shift predictor. Response plane pairs calculated for the unit pairs with flat cross-correlograms showed no predictable relationship. The pairs with a dip in the center of the cross-correlograms always had response planes that were antagonistic (i.e., approximate negative images of each other). When one cell was excited, the second cell was inhibited, and vice versa. More detailed analysis, using the logical response plane, demonstrated that the majority of the antagonistic response planes had either excitatory or inhibitory overlap. That is, the cells were simultaneously excited and/or inhibited at specific spatiotemporal loci on the response plane. These data are consistent with a feed-forward inhibitory circuit in LGN. Furthermore, the data suggest that retinal centers (PE domains) produce LGN excitatory centers (PE domains) and inhibitory centers (PI domains). In turn, retinal excitatory surrounds (SE domains) produce LGN excitatory surrounds (SE domains) and inhibitory surrounds (SI domains).", "references": []},

This paper presents a more accurate function for the generation of hilights which is based on some experimental measurements of how light reflects from real surfaces. It differs from previous models in that the intensity of the hilight changes with the direction of the light source. Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models. Finally, the hilight function generates different results when simulating metallic vs. nonmetallic surfaces.

In this model information is accumulated on memory elements as products of component data. Denoting a key vector by q(p), and the data associated with it by another vector x(p), the pairs (q(p), x(p)) are memorized in the form of a matrix {see the Equation in PDF File} where c is a constant. A randomly selected subset of the elements of Mxq can also be used for memorizing. The recalling of a particular datum x(r) is made by a transformation x(r)=Mxqq(r). This model is failure tolerant and facilitates associative search of information; these are properties that are usually assigned to holographic memories. Two classes of memories are discussed: a complete correlation matrix memory (CCMM), and randomly organized incomplete correlation matrix memories (ICMM). The data recalled from the latter are stochastic variables but the fidelity of recall is shown to have a deterministic limit if the number of memory elements grows without limits. A special case of correlation matrix memories is the auto-associative memory in which any part of the memorized information can be used as a key. The memories are selective with respect to accumulated data. The ICMM exhibits adaptive improvement under certain circumstances. It is also suggested that correlation matrix memories could be applied for the classification of data.", "references": ["The-possibilities-of-neural-holographic-processes-Westlake/90b97e13f383f5e54cd3becef1d570b8b50c7969"]},

There are nine labels associated with each image point, eight labels indicating line segments at various orientations and one indicating the no-line case. Attached to each label is a probability. In the relaxation process, interaction takes place among the probabilities at neighboring points. This permits line segments in compatible orientations to strengthen one another, and incompatible segments to weaken one another. Similarly, no-line labels are reinforced by neighboring no-line labels and weakened by appropriately oriented line labels. This process converges, in only a few iterations, to a condition in which points lying on long curves have achieved high line probabilities, while other points have high no-line probabilities, There is some tendency, under this process, for curves to thicken; however, a thinning procedure can be incorporated to counteract this.

The extent of this variability is of interest for both method-ological and theoretical reasons. Methodologically, it is valuable to know what number of samples taken over what period of time adequately assesses a cell's response characteristics. Theoretically, some light may be shed on cortical connectivity by determining the relative variability of cell subgroups and the difference in variability between responses elicited by optimal and non-optimal stimuli. We obtained a measure of response variability for 333 neurons in striate cortex and for 16 neurons in the LGN. The data were collected from 46 monkeys (Macaca mulatta) in the standard acute preparation; they were paralyzed with Flaxedil and were artificially respired with 30 ~ O~-70 ~ N20. Only cells with receptive fields 2-5 \u00b0 from the fovea are included in this sample. The data collection and stimulus presentation system capable of producing visual stimuli in random order has been described elsewhere 5. Variability data were collected over the 3-4 rain period when the best orientation or length of an edge or bar was being assessed by sweeping a stimulus of optimal velocity across the receptive field using a waveform generator and a mirror galvanometer. All the impulses elicited during this sweep, which was typically 1 sec in duration per trial, were counted as the response. To obtain an index of variability the standard deviation of the response to 10 repeated presentations of a given stimulus was divided by the mean response and multiplied by 100. Low values indicate a cell with consistent responses and hence low variability; high values show high variability. Using a stimulus of optimal orientation, length, and velocity, the average index of variability for all units was 35.2 with a standard deviation of 20. Breakdowns of variability for simple (S-type) and complex (CX-type) cell groups appear in Fig. 1A. S-type cells are those oriented units which show spatially separated contrast specific subfields; CX-type cells are those oriented units which throughout their receptive fields respond to both light increment and light decrement 5. These categories correspond generally to Hubel and Wiesel's a distinction between these two subgroups.

Kidd", "Robert H. Wolfe"], "date": "1976", "abstract": "A technique i s presented for constructing a mathematical model of an Earth resources remote sensor. The technique combines established models of electronic and optical components with formulated models of scan and vibration effects, and it includes a model of the radiation effects of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The resulting composite model is useful for predicting in-flight sensor performance, and a descriptive set of performance parameters is derived in terms of the model. A method is outlined for validating the model for each sensor of interest. The validation for one airborne infrared scanning system is accomplished in part by a satisfactory comparison of predicted response with laboratory data for that sensor. Introduction Multispectral scanning systems are used to gather remotely sensed radiometric data for a wide variety of applications, e.g., pollution monitoring, geological and urban surveying, and crop classification [ 1 31. The measure of performance of such a system can be expressed in terms of its image-resolving capability and its radiometric accuracy. The former measures the system\u2019s capability to discern a scene from imposed noise, and the latter expresses the accuracy to which the system measures the radiant power from the scene. These performance parameters are critical in assessing the usefulness of a particular system for a particular remote sensing program, and they are instrumental in determining the design requirements of an advanced sensor system. The desired performance parameters are generally not measured directly, and they must be inferred by mathematical analysis from more direct laboratory measurements and manufacturer\u2019s specifications. Such a performance evaluation of existing systems or the development of design requirements for an advanced system can be carried out in a systematic way by constructing a mathematical model of the sensor system, component by component, where each component model is parametrized by performance values obtainable from laboratory measurements or design specifications. The purpose of this paper is to develop a linear systems approach to mathematically model a typical remote sensor configuration and to predict system Performance characteristics. This approach, which treats the remote sensor as a communication system, has been used extensively to model electronic systems, as described by Papoulis [4]. The theory has been extended to optical imaging systems by Goodman [ 5 ] . Thus, this paper applies the combined optical and electronic systems theories to provide an end-to-end model of the sensor system. In addition to the sensor component characteristics, atmospheric effects are considered. The discussion is opened with a description of the sensor configuration to be modeled. Next, the mathematical models of the atmosphere and individual system components are developed, and these models are combined to provide the total system model. The components are assumed to be linear, invariant systems, and their models are expressed in terms of transfer functions. The prediction of overall system capability is derived in terms of the transfer functions and system noise characteristics. Finally, the procedure for validating the model with test data is outlined and applied to available laboratory tests for an infrared sensor used in the NASA Earth resources aircraft program. Typical sensor system The sensor system considered measures, in a number of spectral bands, the solar radiation reflected from or the thermal radiation emitted by the ground. The general spectral characteristics of the received radiation are illustrated in Fig. l for an orbital sensor viewing 300-K ground with 20 percent reflectivity [6]. These characteristics are representative of airborne sensors as well. Typically, a number of narrow spectral bands are utilized in the 0.4 pm to 2 pm wavelength region (from ultraviolet, through visible, to near infrared, respectively), and one or two bands are defined for the thermal infrared region from 8 pm to 14 pm, as shown in Fig. 1 . 29 JANUARY 1976 REMOTE SENSOR MODELING", "references": []},

In area 17, the A geniculate laminae (A and A1) had two main bands of projection, one extending from the bottom of IVc to the deepest cells in layer III, and one in layer VI. The C geniculate laminae projected in two dense bands to the upper and lower borders of layer IV, thus bracketing the A laminae projection, though with some overlap. In addition, the C laminae projected to the superficial half of layer I, which the A laminae did not. Conversely, while the A laminae projected to layer VI, the C laminae did not. The two sets of laminae also showed differences in the areas to which they projected. The A geniculate laminae projected to areas 17 and 18, whereas the C geniculate laminae had a more extensive projection, including areas 17, 18, 19 and other areas on the suprasylvian gyrus. The laminar organization of the projection to area 18 was similar to that found in area 17. At the electron microscopic level the geniculate terminals were found to make Gray's type 1 synapses, for the most part onto dendritic spines. Labeled terminals were found in all the projection bands seen in the light microscope. The implications of these findings on the connectivity of cells in layer IV are discussed. The presence of labeled terminals in layer VI, which contains the cells of origin of the corticogeniculate pathway, suggests that the recurrent loop to the LGN is mediated monosynaptically. Finally, the afferents from each geniculate lamina were found to be segregated into patches, about 500 mum wide, which probably form the anatomical basis for ocular dominance columns.", "references": ["Evidence-of-W-cell-input-to-the-cat's-visual-cortex-Wilson-Stone/c9fd1e12aaa354eedd5a3c63d5df9cf523cd0376", "Long-latency-retinal-input-to-lateral-geniculate-of-Cleland-Morstyn/1bfcea35267d6957eb7ea80700b83a3bdda269c1", "The-origin-of-efferent-pathways-from-the-primary-of-Lund-Lund/477a0f55cb4b88a5d610103c797d16d5523201e6", "The-projections-of-cells-in-different-layers-of-the-Gilbert-Kelly/17ca3842ab4ce43485c385a28ba6f5c671edc43c", "The-projections-of-different-morphological-types-of-Kelly-Gilbert/c44233c7aee8d03ce2c508d7c1cd6a72bd6178af", "An-autoradiographic-study-of-retinogeniculate-in-Hickey-Guillery/da0f32754604074dd82944df25ec779c17813a81", "An-autoradiographic-study-of-the-projections-of-the-Rosenquist-Edwards/4cebce49a943616904bd20142235665cf4db1c73", "Autoradiographic-demonstration-of-ocular-dominance-Wiesel-Hubel/0c8ef5350359847cf54d2b909014951a3c619b61", "Accumulation-of-radioactive-protein-in-mouse-cortex-Specht-Grafstein/9c0a9e5580a953b6fba9d2f20b4f093eccfe0855", "Projection-of-X-and-Y-cells-of-the-cat's-lateral-to-Stone-Dreher/3f19dd2bd8fb3e0d6e001d2f92a5599724813a8b"]},

In this paper we show several new methods for generating iso-dipole textures with micropatterns consisting of 5 or more disks or non-disk shaped elements, and we report the discovery of two other Class B detectors, a corner detector (using a 6-disk method), and a closure detector (with 8\u201311 disk micropatterns).

The properties of single cells in striate cortex of the rhesus monkey, representing the visual field 2 degrees -5 degrees from the fovea, were examined quantitatively with stationary and moving stimuli.

S-type cells were defined as those oriented cells which to the optimal direction of movement in their receptive fields exhibited one or more spatially separate subfields within each of which a response was obtained to either a light or dark edge, but not to both. Several different types of S-cells were distinguished: a) S1-type cells for which moving edges revealed a single excitatory area within which a response was elicited by either a light or a dark edge but not by both. Most of these cells were unidirectional. b) S2-type cells for which moving edges revealed two spatially separate response areas, one of which was excited by a light edge and the other by a dark edge. Both regions responded to the same direction of movement. c) S3-type cells which had two response areas, one of which was excited by a stimulus moving in one direction (at right angles to the axis of orientation) and the other, of opposite contrast, which responded in the opposite direction, d) S4-type cells which to one direction of movement showed two spatially separate regions sensitive to a light and dark edge and which in the other direction of movement had only one responsive area (either light or dark). e) Cells which had multiple spatially separate subfields (S5-7 types). 3. CX-type cells were defined as those oriented cells which in their receptive fields exhibited no spatial separation for light- and dark-edge responses; they discharged to both edges in the same direction of movement and in the same spatial area. Flashing stimuli elicited both on and off responses throughout the receptive field. CX-type cells were predominantly of two types: those which were selective for direction of stimulus movement and those which were not. 4. A third class of cells (T-type) were those which were excited by only one sign of contrast change and responded in a sustained fashion even when there was no contour within the receptive field. These cells were poorly or not at all oriented; some of them were selective to wavelength. 5. Quantitative comparisons showed the following differences between S-type and CX-type cells: a) S-type cells had smaller receptive fields than CX-type cells but the populations over-lapped considerably. Receptive-field size was smallest in layer 4c. In all other layers S-type cells had the same size fields. CX-type cells, by contrast, tended to have larger fields in layer 5-6 than 2-3. b) The spatial separation between light and dark response areas was the best criterion for distinguishing S-type and CX-type cells. The distribution of this measure disclosed two populations of cells with relatively limited overlap. c) In layers 2 and 3, both S-type and CX-type cells had low spontaneous activity...", "references": ["Functional-classes-of-cells-and-their-laminar-in-Dow/9c333b263aaf7671b55cddae75e89639fb2a7ac2", "The-visual-cortex-as-a-spatial-frequency-analyser.-Maffei-Fiorentini/929418e2cdee45d16d0493b9a2361fcc8682be2d", "Sequence-regularity-and-geometry-of-orientation-in-Hubel-Wiesel/1c387b70f37fd902735e6c2b76d9715a251d1b5e", "Receptive-fields-and-functional-architecture-of-Hubel-Wiesel/1116467d67f475d1bd2539862f10f792032fe13b", "Receptive-Fields-and-Functional-Architecture-in-Two-Hubel-Wiesel/f70c54029c17f50914996c834930ecbfacda195f", "Receptive-fields%2C-binocular-interaction-and-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/6b4fe4aa4d66fecc7b2869569002714d91d0b3f7", "Receptive-fields-of-single-neurones-in-the-cat's-Hubel-Wiesel/6f20e254e3993538c79e0ff2b9b8f198d3359cb3", "Short-term-response-variability-of-monkey-striate-Schiller-Finlay/49966d7bc963d8d6e1bc67fe0246461e604c85e3", "Response-characteristics-of-single-cells-in-the-or-Schiller-Stryker/af0c7e6926b1eaa4b61284cecfe9258b586b1b82"]},

Complex cells in cortical areas 17 and 18 of the cat have been studied in response to narrow slits and edges moving across the receptive field in the preferred direction and also to stationary slits of different widths. 2. Average response histograms, recorded as a narrow slit was moved across the receptive field, displayed a periodic series of peaks above a base line level. The response histogram for most area 17 and 18 cells contained five principal peaks; sometimes one or two weaker peaks were present at receptive field borders. The histogram for one cell located at the area 17-18 border showed thirteen distinct peaks. Periodic response patterns were also generated as an extended edge was moved across the receptive field. Plots of cell responses versus slit width for stationary slits of different widths also indicated periodic response pattern. 3. The accuracy of determining the preferred slit orientation was the single most important requirement for demonstrating the periodic response pattern. Significant changes in the appearance of the periodic pattern occurred even upon 5 degrees rotations away from the preferred orientation. 4. Average response histograms were also studied over a wide range of moving slit velocities. The number of peaks across corresponding spacings within the recewptive field remained constant over a range of velocities. Response amplitudes, however, were velocity dependent. Thus the response peaks remain associated with fixed positions within visual space independent of stimulus velocity, even though temporal as well as spatial factors may be involved in response selectivity and the periodic modulation. The most striking periodic response histograms were generated at the velocities which produced the greatest cell firing rates. Area 17 complex cells responded well to velocities of less than 0-5 degrees to 6-0 degrees/sec, but cells in area 18 generally required higher velocities, sometimes as high as 20 degrees--30 degrees/sec, for a good response. 5. Spatial frequencies for the periodic component of the receptive field for area 17 cells in the central visual area covered a range of three octaves up to 5 cycles/degree, and area 18 cells included another octave on the low frequency side. The spatial frequency of a cell was found to be roughly inversely proportional to the receptive field width.

Hubel", "Torsten N. Wiesel"], "date": "1962", "abstract": "What chiefly distinguishes cerebral cortex from other parts of the central nervous system is the great diversity of its cell types and inter-connexions. It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to CAT VISUAL CORTEX 107 the somatic sensory cortex of the cat and monkey in a remarkable series of studies by Mountcastle (1957) and Powell & Mountcastle (1959). Their results show that the approach is a powerful one, capable of revealing systems of organization not hinted at by the known morphology. In Part III of the present paper we use this method in studying the functional architecture of the visual cortex.

The effects of temperature on the decay rate of end-plate currents were investigated over a temperature range from 10 to 30.5 degrees C. The Q(10) for the decay constant of end-plate currents depends somewhat on membrane potential; at - 100 mV the decay constant has a Q(10) of 2.7.3. Peak end-plate current depends non-linearly on membrane potential with a decreasing slope conductance associated with hyperpolarization.4. The ;instantaneous' voltage-current relationship for end-plate channels was determined by causing step changes in membrane potential during end-plate current flow. This relationship appears to be linear.5. The interaction of acetylcholine with its receptor is viewed as being analogous to the first step in enzymic catalysis. On this view, acetylcholine binds to its receptor and induces a conformational change which is responsible for opening end-plate channels. By analogy to the first steps in the catalytic sequence of enzymes, the binding step is very rapid, almost diffusion-limited, and the conformational change is rate-limiting.6. Equations describing this process have been derived. Expressions for the rate constants have also been derived by considering changing dipole moments of the transmitter-receptor complex associated with the conformational change. As the transmitter-receptor complex is in the membrane field, different conformational states have different energies, and the rate of conformational change thus depends on membrane potential. The equations thus derived are shown to account adequately for the time course of end-plate conductance change.", "references": []},

Cells projecting to the lateral geniculate nucleus are small to medium sized pyramidal neurons with somata in lamina 6 and the adjacent white matter. The projection to the parvocellular division arises preferentially from the upper half of lamina 6, while that to the magnocellular division arises preferentially from the lower part of the lamina. The projection to both superior colliculus and inferior pulvinar arises from all sizes of pyramidal neurons lying in lamina 58 (Lund and Boothe, '75); at least pyramidal neurons of lamina 5B send collateral axon branches to both destinations. Injections with extensive spread of horseradish peroxidase show that many cells of lamina 4B and the large pyramidal neurons of upper lamina 6 also project extrinsically but their terminal sites have not been identified. Other studies have indicated that cells of laminae 2 and 3 project to areas 18 and 19. Therefore every lamina of the visual cortex, with the exception of those receiving a direct thalamic input, contains cells projecting extrinsically. Further, each lamina projects to a different destination and from Golgi studies can be shown to contain cells with specific patterns of dendritic branching which relate to the distribution of thalamic afferents and to the patterns of intracortical connections. These findings emphasise the significance of the horizontal organisation of the cortex with relation to the flow of information through it and contrast with the current concept of columnar organisation shown in physiological studies.", "references": []},

In the cat, the majority of studies reveal a dramatic loss of binocularity and direction selectivity in superficial collicular units following ablation of the visual cortex (1, 18, 25). In the ground squirrel, removal of the visual cortex renders most cells in the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus unresponsive to visual stimuli (14); this also appears to apply to the cat (22). Work on the rabbit, however, indicates that in this species, ablation of visual cortex produces no discernible effects on collicular function (10). The present study has been undertaken to investigate the contribution of visual cortex to collicular function in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), a species whose visual svstem is believed to be rather similar to that of man. Neuroanatomical work has indicated that in the monkey, as in the cat, retina and visual cortex project densely on the superior colliculus (8). In the monkey, a foveate animal, an interesting specialization has been reported: anterograde-degeneration and autoradiographic studies indicate that the anterior part of the colliculus, representing the central 5\u201d of the visual field, receives extremely sparse or no terminations from the retina and, conversely, heavy projections from visual cortex (5, 9, 26) Single-unit studies of the superior colliculus of the intact monkey have disclosed that, as in the cat, most cells have binocular", "references": ["Retinotopic-fidelity-of-striate-cortex-superior-in-McIlwain/f3f4fa476d3cc4572fe782e424411d74225859f1", "Topographic-relationships-in-projection-from-cortex-McIlwain/322deda02290f4bb4c8dc637431dc8561aac6a6e", "Activity-of-superior-colliculus-in-behaving-monkey.-Wurtz-Goldberg/31d32ffc4a17a7a13d5aa795e1b32e1261355f7d", "Comparison-of-receptive-field-organization-of-the-Berman-Cynader/0e3365dbf0c13d5d97c759ad523aefc0728c14e6", "Eye-movements-evoked-by-collicular-stimulation-in-Robinson/da489fdca8f59f0f0d8ce5289d35f4aa93b75e7c", "Receptive-field-organization-of-monkey-superior-Cynader-Berman/c1e1c160ed7bbb4ff42f108d5bbd027f6ff6b83a", "Synaptic-patterns-in-the-superficial-layers-of-the-Lund/be8419ac3a1aa68dec502a5af10180996326adb1", "Visual-receptive-fields-of-single-neurons-in-of-the-Michael/e8bafc515c9f189331d220260016b5dfd9205f63", "Discharge-characteristics-of-single-units-in-of-the-Schiller-Koerner/3b292431072ce0555191832ec80e5b2aee3fc3e8"]},

The striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized macaque and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly from single units and stimulating the retinas with spots or patterns of light. Most cells can be categorized as simple, complex, or hypercomplex, with response properties very similar to those previously described in the cat. On the average, however, receptive fields are smaller, and there is a greater sensitivity to changes in stimulus orientation. A small proportion of the cells are colour coded.2. Evidence is presented for at least two independent systems of columns extending vertically from surface to white matter. Columns of the first type contain cells with common receptive-field orientations. They are similar to the orientation columns described in the cat, but are probably smaller in cross-sectional area. In the second system cells are aggregated into columns according to eye preference. The ocular dominance columns are larger than the orientation columns, and the two sets of boundaries seem to be independent.3. There is a tendency for cells to be grouped according to symmetry of responses to movement; in some regions the cells respond equally well to the two opposite directions of movement of a line, but other regions contain a mixture of cells favouring one direction and cells favouring the other.4. A horizontal organization corresponding to the cortical layering can also be discerned. The upper layers (II and the upper two-thirds of III) contain complex and hypercomplex cells, but simple cells are virtually absent. The cells are mostly binocularly driven. Simple cells are found deep in layer III, and in IV A and IV B. In layer IV B they form a large proportion of the population, whereas complex cells are rare. In layers IV A and IV B one finds units lacking orientation specificity; it is not clear whether these are cell bodies or axons of geniculate cells. In layer IV most cells are driven by one eye only; this layer consists of a mosaic with cells of some regions responding to one eye only, those of other regions responding to the other eye. Layers V and VI contain mostly complex and hypercomplex cells, binocularly driven.5. The cortex is seen as a system organized vertically and horizontally in entirely different ways. In the vertical system (in which cells lying along a vertical line in the cortex have common features) stimulus dimensions such as retinal position, line orientation, ocular dominance, and perhaps directionality of movement, are mapped in sets of superimposed but independent mosaics. The horizontal system segregates cells in layers by hierarchical orders, the lowest orders (simple cells monocularly driven) located in and near layer IV, the higher orders in the upper and lower layers.", "references": ["Orientational-selectivity-of-the-human-visual-Campbell-Kulikowski/9814c03deeef765d0b57581723d326e75aa41bdd", "Binocular-interaction-in-striate-cortex-of-kittens-Hubel-Wiesel/76e4b735610508f33ab1cb5148efeb20bcd19bcc", "Receptive-Fields-and-Functional-Architecture-in-Two-Hubel-Wiesel/f70c54029c17f50914996c834930ecbfacda195f", "Shape-and-arrangement-of-columns-in-cat's-striate-Hubel-Wiesel/d7fb932bca642615fcbcf3f5d26b2c26666603d3", "Receptive-fields%2C-binocular-interaction-and-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/6b4fe4aa4d66fecc7b2869569002714d91d0b3f7", "Spectral-responses-of-single-units-in-the-primate-Motokawa-Taira/32eb84773c5531c816f1eb958a9d85a1ad1de37c"]},

Responses to moving spots often varied with the direction of movement. It was clear that such responses must be the result of complex integrative mechanisms. The present study was undertaken to find out whether similar responses occur in retinal ganglion cells or cells of the dorsal lateral geniculate body. Lateral geniculate units have not previously been studied with restricted light stimulation, and although the cat's retinal ganglion cell has been extensively investigated by Kuffler and his co-workers (Kuffler, 1953; iKuffler, FitzHugh & Barlow, 1957), responses to moving spots were not examined. Thus it has not been possible to say whether the complex activity of cortical units originates in the cortex itself, or at lower levels.

Marr"], "date": "1976", "abstract": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down.", "references": []},

The most effective stimulus shapes are long narrow rectangles of light ('slits'), dark bars against a light background ('dark bars'), and straight-line borders separating areas of different brightness ('edges'). A given cell responds vigorously when an appropriate stimulus is shone on the receptive field or moved across it, provided the stimulus is presented in a specific orientation. This orientation is termed the 'receptive-field axis orientation'. It is critical, and constant for any particular cell, but may differ for different cells. The visual cortex is subdivided into discrete regions or columns extending from surface to white matter, in which all cells have the same receptivefield axis orientation (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962). The present experiments were undertaken with the object of learning more about the anatomical configuration of the columns. We wished to have a clearer idea of their shape, especially if the walls of a column were, as previous work suggested, parallel to the radial fibre bundles of the cortex and perpendicular to the cortical layers, and whether the columns were uniform or irregular in their cross-sectional shape and size. Furthermore, we were curious to know if there was any relationship between the receptive-field axis orientations of neighbouring columns, or whether, on the contrary, the different columns were intermixed in a random way throughout the cortex. These questions were approached: (1) by making several deep, closely spaced, parallel micro-electrode penetrations, placing electrolytic lesions at every shift in receptive-field orientation, and(2) by making many short penetrations in a small cortical area, noting the axis orientation of cells lying in the upper one or two layers of cortex.", "references": ["Receptive-fields%2C-binocular-interaction-and-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/6b4fe4aa4d66fecc7b2869569002714d91d0b3f7", "Receptive-fields-of-optic-nerve-fibres-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/b0b13465c36789ebd0751178c5403efd4dd390b9", "Modality-and-topographic-properties-of-single-of-Mountcastle/25da3e1aa66df347c0ef3bf90d00543e091a9b8d", "Chamber-for-microelectrode-studies-in-the-cerebral-Davies/1a514336509281e43e27925603a37901fd72334f"]},

The functions of very few of these cell types are known in any detail. The rods and cones almost certainly absorb the light quanta and are responsible for the initiation of the train of events which culminates in the nerve impulse patterns of the ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerve. This pat tern of nerve impulses is modified by the intensity, shape, and duration of the illumination falling on the retina. In a few types of vertebrate eyes it is also certain that the color of the stimulating light must modify the response patterns of different ganglion cells in a differential fashion. This is a requirement in any system of color vision, and it is fairly certain from behavioral experiments that these animals are able to distinguish colors. Many species of fish apparently can be trained to recognize colors. For this reason the fish retina is an appropriate place to find out how color information is encoded for transmission along the optic nerve. The response patterns of single ganglion cells of the vertebrate retina have been the subject of extensive study since Hartline's successful isolation of the ganglion cells of the frog retina. These response patterns were classified by Hartl ine (1938) into \"on ,\" \"off,\" and \"on-off ' ' types according to the temporal relationship of the discharge to the illumination. These descriptive terms have been generally accepted by subsequent investigators and are in wide usage today. The response patterns of ganglion cells of a wide variety of other vertebrates have been examined by subsequent investigators. This work has indicated that the discharge patterns are basically similar. The \"on-off ' ' type is most frequently seen and is looked on as playing the dominant role in the functional organization.

Kuffler"], "date": "1953", "abstract": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15).

There is good evidence (Walls, 1942) that color vision systems have evolved several separate times, once in the insects, again in fish, reptiles, and birds, and still again within the primate order. If this is correct, it would be little more than a coincidence ff the way in which information about the wavelength of light is encoded in the visual system of monkey and man were the same as the manner in which it is accomplished in fish or birds. In any case, if one is interested in relating the ways in which various neural elements respond to different wavelengths of light under various conditions to the manner in which these lights are perceived, one cannot go wrong in studying an animal as similar as possible to man, for virtually all of the behavioral results from color discrimination have been obtained on the human observer. The macaque lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), from which most of the recordings have been obtained, consists of six layers of cells separated by fiber layers. These cells receive connections from the axons of the ganglion cells of the retina and are thus the fourth-order neurons in the visual pathway. Anatomical studies (Glees and Le Gros Clark, 1941) have given little evidence for interconnections at this level; the types of responses recorded here may well be essentially the same as one would obtain from ganglion cells in the retina. However, the highly laminated structure of the LGN, in which the optic projection from each eye splits three ways, presents the possibility of some clues being present as to the nature of the organization of the visual system in the differential responses of cells in the various laminae. For this, as well as for certain technical reasons, the L G N rather than the retina was chosen as the recording site.", "references": ["Kinetics-of-cone-pigments-measured-objectively-on-Rushton/eddc701be8ac6e64f0d6d65fba5b2537a35a691f", "Retinal-mechanisms-for-chromatic-and-achromatic-Svaetichin-Macnichol/f458a89b3a7da0197458bf0efbb74d459e5cbfde", "Electrical-responses-of-primate-visual-system.-I.-Valois-Smith/01a9e0b0e409a6bd81c21a32b18c087482b55fa0", "An-opponent-process-theory-of-color-vision.-Hurvich-Jameson/51c840deb135375b01e72ca4847aa8929d368abe"]},

Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli", "references": ["Single-unit-activity-in-lateral-geniculate-body-and-Hubel/401185a7ba67af1e01e5278932747e5fd777d3a6", "Single-unit-activity-in-striate-cortex-of-cats.-Hubel/5a0c4a618425328ba0bbb9737b02e2ac18f94646", "Excitation%2C-inhibition-and-coordination-of-cortical-Jung/21ea32c994d409d01b9ad329e3eea371b0dea8d6", "Change-of-organization-in-the-receptive-fields-of-Barlow-Fitzhugh/929f33d2c4ede915b830e5a47b5007cd4c870386", "Modality-and-topographic-properties-of-single-of-Mountcastle/25da3e1aa66df347c0ef3bf90d00543e091a9b8d", "Tungsten-Microelectrode-for-Recording-from-Single-Hubel/b1af783dad1a0726bece45185410db4d2c13e8b1", "Chamber-for-microelectrode-studies-in-the-cerebral-Davies/1a514336509281e43e27925603a37901fd72334f", "Potentials-recorded-from-the-spinal-cord-with-Frank-Fuortes/e0f74c5455b3c112348bc3464829e8270c780b7a", "Discharge-patterns-and-functional-organization-of-Kuffler/d11cf80190fcef83ac52086ee44876fda7507dfa"]},

Recordings were made with metal electrodes or with small micropipettes from ganglion cells or nerve fibers. Continuous maintained discharges were seen in all ganglion cells during steady illumination of their receptive fields, as well as in complete darkness. Possible artefacts, such as electrode pressure, abnormal circulation, anesthetic, and several other factors have been excluded as the source of the maintained discharge. Visual stimuli are therefore transmitted by modulating the ever present background activity. Discharge frequencies were measured following changes of retinal illumination. No consistent patterns of frequency change were found. The maintained discharge frequency may be permanently increased or decreased, or may remain practically unchanged by altering the steady level of illumination. In addition, there were often transient frequency changes during the first 5 to 10 minutes after changing illumination, before a final steady rate was established. A statistical analysis of the impulse intervals of the maintained discharge showed: (a) the intervals were distributed according to the gamma distribution (Pearson's type III), (b) the first serial correlation coefficient of the intervals was between -0.10 and -0.24, with a mean value of -0.17, which is significantly different from zero, (c) the higher order serial correlation coefficients were not significantly different from zero. Thus the firing probability at any time depends on the times of occurrence of the two preceding impulses only, and in such a way as to indicate that each impulse is followed by a transient depression of excitability that outlasts the following impulse.

This suggests that the anatomical connections between retina and striate cortex are for the most part innate. During the first 3 months of life the connections are highly susceptible to the effects of visual deprivation, to the extent that exclusion of all form and some light from one eye leads to a severe decline in the ability of that eye to influence cortical cells. Anatomical and physiological evidence suggests that the defect is chiefly, though not entirely, a cortical one (7-9). The object of the present study was to influence cortical connections by some means less drastic than covering one or both eyes. We wished if possible to alter the input in such a way that there would be no question of effects on the visual pathway below the level of the striate cortex. A method was suggested by the well-known clinical observation that a child with a squint (strabismus or nonparallel visual axes) may suffer a deterioration of vision in one eye (amblyopia ex anopsia). Since the visual pathways from the two eyes are for practical purposes separate up to the level of the striate cortex, it is unlikely that in these children the defect is in the retina or geniculate. An artificial squint therefore seemed to provide a possible means of obtaining a cortical defect while sparing the retina and lateral geniculate body. Accordingly , we produced a divergent strabismus by cutting one of the extraocular muscles in each of four newborn kittens, with the plan of testing vision and recording from single cortical cells after several months to a year. When at length each eye was tested in these kittens by observing the ani-mal's behavior with the other eye covered the results were disappointing: there was not the slightest suggestion of any defect in vision in either eye. This was not entirely unexpected, since with both eyes uncovered the animals had appeared to fix at times with one eye and at times with the other. At this stage there seemed to be little point in proceeding further, for there- .", "references": ["Extent-of-recovery-from-the-effects-of-visual-in-Wiesel-Hubel/c2b6bfadb13898d530e7027c2e91849997a26662", "Receptive-Fields-and-Functional-Architecture-in-Two-Hubel-Wiesel/f70c54029c17f50914996c834930ecbfacda195f", "Effects-of-Visual-Deprivation-on-Morphology-and-of-Wiesel-Hubel/30fe0e0ce84a94434e739c3952596c156ded9bcc", "Shape-and-arrangement-of-columns-in-cat's-striate-Hubel-Wiesel/d7fb932bca642615fcbcf3f5d26b2c26666603d3", "Single-cell-Responses-in-Striate-Cortex-of-Kittens-Wiesel-Hubel/2cc9381734376a5b5e309409b230c3bf753a9fd4", "Receptive-fields%2C-binocular-interaction-and-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/6b4fe4aa4d66fecc7b2869569002714d91d0b3f7"]},

Cynader", "Nancy Berman"], "date": "1972", "abstract": "A NUMBER OF recent studies suggest that the mammalian superior colliculus plays a crucial role in visually guided behavior (33, 35). Ablation experiments indicate that lesions in the hamster superior colliculus can cause severe deficits in orienting to visual and auditory stimuli while leaving intact the ability to discriminate pat serns in situ .ations in whi ch no orienting component is necessary for the successful performance of the discrimination (32). Related to this view is the idea that the colliculus plays an important role in the control of eye and head movements. After unilateral colliculectomy in the monkey, Denny-Brown (6) reports a fascinating cluster of eye-movement deficits. While the animal could look to either side or up and down, there was a slight divergent strabismus, and the optokinetic response was present only when the stripes entered the visual field from the operated side. Though the monkey could reach accurately for an object in the visual field contralateral to the lesion, he could not fixate the object, but only looked in its general direction. After bilateral colliculus lesions, monkeys showed fixed gaze, lack of reactivity to visual stimuli; lack of vocalization, and a variety of other deficits which led Denny-Brown to describe this structure as the \u201cpattern setter of the nervous system.\u201d Though other workers have failed to confirm the oculomotor deficits reported in this study (2, 28), recent work usi *g more sophisticated methods for head immobilization and eyemovement recording has confirmed and extended many of Denny-Brown\u2019s original observations (M.

Ablation studies have shown that destruction of superior colliculi interferes with spatial orientation and eye movement (Z-29), although the evidence regarding the effects of such lesions in primates is conflicting (1, 7, 17, 18; and unpublished observations). Stimulation studies have disclosed that electrical or chemical stimulation of the superior colliculus elicits eye and head movement in several species (4, 1 I, 20, 22). While most single-unit studies centered on the visual information-processing role of the mammalian superior colliculi (12-16, 30, 32, 33; M. Cynader and N. Berman, unpublished observations), a few studies have recently appeared that demonstrate eye-movement related unit activity (22, 31, 35) The aim of the present study was to investigate the discharge characteristics of single units in the superior colliculus of the alert, unanesthe tized monkey. We wished to assess both the visual receptivefield characteristics of units and the possible relation of unit discharges to eye movement. To carry out this plan one eye of each monkey was immobilized prior to the experiment by transection of the 3rd, 4th, and 6th cranial nerves. This made it possible to study in the monkey, whose head was restrained, receptive fields of units of the immobilized eye, and to relate the discharge characteristics of collicular units to the movement of the normal eye during both saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements.

In addition, the existence of a random maintained discharge from retinal ganglion cells (Kuffler, FitzHugh & Barlow, 1957) raises some doubts about the relative parts played by the retina and the central nervous system in determining thresholds. We therefore set out to measure the absolute threshold of the large type of ganglion cell (Rushton, 1949) isolated by metallic micro-electrodes of the type used by Granit & Svaetichin (1939). The opportunity was taken of following threshold through the period of dark adaptation, and some observations of the Purkinje shift were made.", "references": ["Maintained-Activity-in-the-Cat's-Retina-in-Light-Kuffler-Fitzhugh/83cf69db1a2897e0bf0a250cfe64a0fcf1835eb7", "The-Statistical-Detection-of-Threshold-Signals-in-Fitzhugh/1cafd6a835be70194ab6aac853888cdaca743fad", "Measurement-of-Rhodopsin-in-the-Living-Human-Eye-Rushton-Campbell/def1bb48455f810bbff86471ca9928d32774968d", "On-the-mechanism-of-the-visual-threshold-and-visual-Wald/878a934bca7c98fdc5ab2079ac88ef784909f6b0"]},

How is it possible to get such good insulation in a packed structure like the retina using a 25-\u00b5 electrode? Why are large isolated spikes only found in some spots and not elsewhere? Is it because some typical structure happens to be exceptionally favourably placed for recording, or is the structure a comparatively rare one?

These methods eliminate anaesthetics, paralysing drugs, brain-stem lesions, and other acute experimental procedures. They make it possible to record electrical events in the higher central nervous system with the animal in a normal state, and to correlate these electrical events with such variables as waking state, attention, learning, and motor activity. The present paper describes a method for unit recording from the cortex of unanaesthetized, unrestrained cats, and presents some observations from the striate cortex. The objectives have been (1) to observe maintained unit activity under various conditions such as sleep and wakefulness, and (2) to find for each unit the natural stimuli which most effectively influence firing. Of 400 units observed, some 200 are presented here because of their common characteristics. Since there is reason to believe that the remainiing 200 units were afferent fibres from the lateral geniculate nucleus, these will be described in a separate paper.

The response areas of the new elements show a sharp limit on the high-frequency side and very gradual elevation of threshold on the low-frequency side. The elements studied previously had, on the contrary, fairly narrow response areas with a clear maximum of sensitivity for a certain frequency that was characteristic of the element under observation.

Photographic records of impulses from single ganglion cells in the cat's retina were made while the retina was stimulated by flashes occurring once a second. Ten flashes at each of several intensities near threshold were used. 2. For the purpose of statistical analysis, the number of impulses (x) falling within a critical period following each flash was used as an index of the response. Histograms of x were plotted and used to calculate rates of transfer of information by the ganglion cell for the case of an ideal experiment, the yes-no choice, in which flashes of intensity I and blanks are to be distinguished. 3. The information rate increased (a) with increasing stimulus intensity and (b) with the number of identical flashes or blanks presented successively in a block. The intensity chosen as threshold by the experimenter, who observed the impulses visually and aurally, corresponded to an average information rate for single flashes of 0.7 bit/flash, compared to the maximum possible rate of 1 bit/flash. A threshold intensity giving 0.4 or more bit/flash, if presented in blocks of six identical flashes, corresponded to 0.95 or more bit/block, or near certainty. Thus the calculation of information rates using the index x provides an estimate of threshold at least as sensitive as those obtained during an experiment, which were made only after observing the responses to five to ten flashes of the same intensity. 4. The index x has statistical properties similar to those of the \"index of neural activity\" used by Tanner and Swets (1954) in their statistical model of human vision, and represents a possible physical interpretation of their index. However, x gave values (0.5 to 1.5) of the parameter called the slope which were consistently smaller than their values (2.1 to 3.1).", "references": ["Properties-of-an-infra-red-receptor.-Bullock-Diecke/5685269ea7fc34bac6177da8f0de31b36e9fe0b6", "The-human-use-of-information-I%3A-Signal-detection-of-Tanner-Swets/09dc4bc616b83dcdea522ca261bb8b360571e056", "The-human-use-of-information-II%3A-Signal-detection-Tanner-Norman/927ca28ae5d24ffa21dc4e23b6a4739fbf5742c1", "The-theory-of-signal-detectability-Peterson-Birdsall/4d899ebf7a3004fe550842830f06b4600d9c6230", "Discharge-patterns-and-functional-organization-of-Kuffler/d11cf80190fcef83ac52086ee44876fda7507dfa"]},

Lesions of superior colliculus or visual cortex in the adult Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) have clearly distinguishable consequences in visually guided behavior [SCHNEIDER, 1966, 1967, 1969].

Moreover, the hamster's colliculus is about as large in surface area as area 17 of the neocortex; and the superficial gray layer of the colliculus, throughout which optic tract terminals are found, has a volume more than twice as great as that of the dorsal nucleus of the lateral geniculate body (unpublished data).", "references": ["Experience-and-vision-of-the-posterior-rat.-Bland-Cooper/21dc21f97275b11383c6daabb3167b766dc9ea07", "Evolution-of-neocortex.-Diamond-Hall/5b943f9b2ca96d8a5d244b69df5aa78fbca0e90d", "Extrageniculostriate-vision-in-the-monkey%3A-of-Pasik-Pasik/ee29b6ffb9b20f3000a0612898d22ac500825ec8", "Neuronal-plasticity-in-the-septal-nuclei-of-the-Raisman/24aeae7e268eabdf38dd597a2d8444f39164e981", "Pattern-discrimination-following-removal-of-visual-Spear-Braun/4300ca7af67111c06605c85091fc5f8437b85b88", "Posterior-neodecortication-in-the-rat%3A-age-at-and-Bland-Cooper/98f5a7a31c64b855f67e3ad5e821ec6278bbcc8b", "The-superior-colliculus-and-higher-visual-functions-Anderson-Symmes/7befab8cdb680017317d731398496c22f7474bfa", "Effects-of-subcortical-lesions-on-brightness-by-Horel/0af0140f6f47909b761838c3905f2727bcd31583"]},

In 1942, Galambos and and Davis (9) recorded electric responses of single ganglion cells in the cochlear nucleus, which they once believed to be from single auditory nerve fibers. Those responses, recorded from the secondary neurons in the auditory system, indicate that each element responds to a tone of a particular frequency with a particularly high sensitivity. Galambos (8) also described an inhibitory interaction between the responses to two different sound stimuli in the cochlear nucleus. It is therefore possible that the selective response of each element at this level of the auditory system to a particular frequency could be largely due to some complicated interaction among nerve impulses arriving at the cochlear nucleus over a large number of primary auditory nerve fibers. Quite recently, it has been shown in this Institute (21,22) that the basal turn of the guinea pig cochlea responds to practically all frequencies in the audible range, while the upper parts of the cochlea respond only to sounds of low frequencies. By the method of differential recording of the microphonic response across the cochlear partition, it was shown that when the response of the upper part of the cochlea (to low-frequency sounds) had been eliminated by a local injection of an isotonic KC1 solution there were still good normal responses in the basal turn, both microphonics and nerve action potentials. These results exclude any sharp localization of vibratory motion in the cochlea. The \u201cresonance curve\u201d obtained by Bekesy (3), which correlates mechanical displacement of the cochlear partition of the dead human and animal ears with place in the cochlea at various frequencies, is not very sharp. Nevertheless, the large microphonic and nerve action potentials induced by low-frequency sound in the basal turn still seem difficult to reconcile with Bekesy\u2019s curves, which show a fairly rapid decay in amplitude of vibration toward the basal turn. More direct information as to the nerve impulses in the primary auditory neurons seemed to offer a solution of this difficulty.", "references": ["Direct-membrane-resting-and-action-potentials-from-Woodbury/8eb023ccbccc0ee6d9515c465eccbc5775045dbf", "Modification-of-cochlear-microphonics-and-action-by-Tasaki-Fernandez/2f5ce95dda4223c7f2aa2dfb75ea17f1a65f3a3b", "Properties-of-myelinated-fibers-in-frog-sciatic-and-Tasaki/ec2c6cad20eda70ca8ef346d2973362a56acbd0a", "Repetitive-responses-of-the-nerve-fiber%2C-as-by-and-Sato/2b690570512365ee0a2f4e1f4e9e9db5350ee35e", "The-peripheral-origin-of-activity%2C-with-reference-Davis-Tasaki/3496406b96f72da25ce827284921291d0f242eec"]},

Wesley Peterson", "Theodore G. Birdsall", "William C. Fox"], "date": "1954", "abstract": "The problem of signal detectability treated in this paper is the following: Suppose an observer is given a voltage varying with time during a prescribed observation interval and is asked to decide whether its source is noise or is signal plus noise. What method should the observer use to make this decision, and what receiver is a realization of that method? After giving a discussion of theoretical aspects of this problem, the paper presents specific derivations of the optimum receiver for a number of cases of practical interest. The receiver whose output is the value of the likelihood ratio of the input voltage over the observation interval is the answer to the second question no matter which of the various optimum methods current in the literature is employed including the Neyman Pearson observer, Siegert's ideal observer, and.Woodward and Davies' tlobserver.lV An optimum observer required to give a yes or no answer simply chooses an operating level and concludes that the receiver input arose from signal plus noise only when this level is exceeded by the output of his likelihood ratio receiver. Associated with each such operating level are conditional probabilities that the answer is a false alarm and the conditional probability of detection. Graphs of these quantities, called receiver operating characteristic, or ROC, curves are convenient for evaluating a receiver. If the detection problem is changed by varying, for example, the signal power, then a family of ROC curves is generated. Such things as betting curves can easily be obtained from such a family. The operating level to be used in a particular situation must be chosen by the observer. His choice will depend on such factors as the permissable false alarm rate, a priori probabilities, and relative importance of errors. With these theoretical aspects serving as sn introduction, attention is devoted to the derivation of explicit formulas for likelihood ratio, and for probability of detection and probability of false alarm, for a number of particular cases. Stationary, band-limited, white Gaussian noise is assumed.. The seven special cases which sre presented were chosen from the simplest problems in signal detection which closely represent practical situations. Two of the cases form a basis for the best available approximation to the important problem of finding probability of detection when the starting time of the signal, signal frequency, or both, are l l&TlOUn. Furthermore, in these two cases uncertainty in the signal can be varied, and a quantitative relationship between uncertainty and ability to detect signals is presented for these two rather general cases. The variety of examples presented should serve to suggest methods for attacking other simple signal detection problems and to give insight into problems too complicated to allow a direct solution.", "references": []},

Cells of this type were silent during slow pursuit movement. Type II cells showed steady discharge when the eyes were oriented in a specific direction. These cells discharged also during smooth pursuit movements and the slow phase of nystagmus, provided that the eyes were moving across positions which would have been associated with neuronal activity had the eyes come to rest there. All of Type II and a few of Type I neurons were identified by antidromic response to stimulation of the cerebral peduncle.

Therefore, it may be necessary to examine whether the frequency of the repetitive response may be determined by the recovery curve or by the response time and to secure rigid experimental data on strength-frequency and strength-duration relations of repetitive responses of a single nerve fiber, although there are accumulated many experimental findings concerning the repetitive responses of the nerve (Fessard, 1936 (6), Erlanger and Blair, 1936 (4) and Arvanitaki, 1938 (2) etc.). The results of this investigation indicated very clearly, against Hodgkin's view, that the frequency of the repetitive responses can be determined by both the recovery curve and the accommodation of the nerve fiber and that the theoretical formula for the threshold condition of the repetition presented in this appendix proved to yield results which agree well with the observed values.", "references": []},

Hurvich", "D. Jameson"], "date": "1957", "abstract": "The two major theoretical accounts of color vision are those classified as the Young-Helmholtz and the Hering types of theories. For many years the former has been judged by most workers in the field to provide the simplest explanation of the way in which light stimuli give rise to color sensations. The advantages that appear to favor the Young-Helmholtz three-component hypothesis are two: it is parsimonious, and its postulates are easily quantifiable and hence subject to precise experimental test. In its parsimonious and easily quantifiable form, the theory is simple: in addition to the rods which subserve twilight vision, the eye contains three kinds of cone photoreceptors; each type of cone contains a differently selective photochemical substance; each is associated with its own specific nerve fiber; and each cone-photochemical-nerve fiber system is correlated with one of the three specific \"fundamental\" color sensations, namely, red, green, and blue (or violet). All sensations are considered as compounded of varying amounts of these three excitatory systems, with white arising from equal and simultaneous excitation of all three, and yellow from equal red and green excitations. The Young-Helmholtz three-cone, three-nerve, three-sensation theory derives directly from the basic fact of color mixture, namely, that all visible hues can be matched by the mixture, in proper proportions, of only three physical light stimuli. Based squarely on this fact, the theory is readily quantified in terms of the three measurable variables of color mixture experiments. But the three measured variables, it 1 Now at New York University. must be emphasized, are the three physical light stimuli used in the color mixture experiments; they are not the postulated three \"fundamental\" color sensations, for with each different stimulus triad used for color matching a different and equally valid triad of color mixture functions is obtained. Consequently, throughout some hundred years since the original formulation of the idea, a continued series of attempts has been made to find the proper transformation of the three measured colormixture curves that will bridge the gap and yield the unique spectral distribution curves of the desired physiological correlates of the three postulated \"fundamental\" color sensations. An infinity of such transformations is available for trial, and almost every serious adherent of the theory has proposed at least one new set of \"fundamental sensation curves\" (48, pp. 368-372). The search, however, continues, because serious defects have been found in every proposal made thus far. When the explanatory or predictive power of the theory in any given quantified form is tested it cannot handle more than a limited number of facts satisfactorily (11, p. 805). Moreover, some facts of color experience seem unassimilable into the framework of the simple Young-Helmholtz theory with its three independent, fundamental, process-sensation systems. How can this system of three independent processes be made to account, for example, for the apparent linkages that seem to occur between specific pairs of colors as either the stimulus conditions or the conditions of the human observer are varied? Why should the red and green hues in the spectrum predominate", "references": ["The-interpretation-of-spectral-sensitivity-curves.-Dartnall/023e7bc440958d2f9bf0e14f8e87eec3c5e2f5d0", "Chromatic-adaptation.-Macadam/64b26959e3453079a2e3cde237af35aa3a5ba88b", "Inhibition-in-the-Eye-of-Limulus-Hartline-Wagner/071924898b2c8a5977424e66287ff5673474db86", "Some-quantitative-aspects-of-an-opponent-colors-in-Jameson-Hurvich/baf4bf9d623a15cdcc6fe7bc9015441e0c2a9c0b", "Some-quantitative-aspects-of-an-opponent-colors-IV.-Hurvich-Jameson/08b27d68866a6f76b47f1df3dd99dcb74b8a42de", "A-quantitative-theoretical-account-of-color-vision.-Hurvich-Jameson/11f35fe8b62d1f15dbb8b2c05b55e53431e20ebd", "Some-quantitative-aspects-of-an-opponent-colors-II.-Hurvich-Jameson/1be5fa64c6de2fa3f18a809e7310efd9f5bd120c"]},

A large motor fiber was isolated from a sciatic-gastrocnemius preparation, and the operated region of the preparation, immersed in Ringer's fluid, was brought under a polarizing microscope with an objective lens of water-immersion type. A micro-electrode of below 0.5 micron in diameter, held by means of a micro-manipulator, was pushed into the nerve fiber, and the potential difference between the intra-cellular electrode and the outside fluid medium was recorded with a cathode-ray oscillograph used in conjunction with a DC amplifier. Action potentials were elicited from the fiber by induction shocks applied to the proximal nerve trunk. Muscular contractions were taken as an index of the propagation of impulses across the impaled region. The main features of the results obtained are as follows: 1. When the tip of the micro-electrode was just under the layer of myelin or when a dimpling of myelin into the axis-cylinder was seen at the tip of the micro-electrode, there was practically no measurable resting potential . But a propagated nerve impulse could very often evoke sizable monophasic action potentials (generally not exceeding 30 mV in peak value) . At this stage, propagation of impulses across the impaled region was not impaired. 2. When the tip of the micro-electrode was introduced deep inside the axis-cylinder, a resting potential of 10 to 40 mV was observed. The action potentials observed at this stage were large at the beginning (20 to 40 mV), but soon a notch appeared at the peak of the action potential . As time elapsed, this notch became more pronounced, and generally within 2 to 5 minutes after introduction of the micro-electrode, a stage was reached at which the part of action potential following the notch suddenly disappeared .

Garey", "Edward G. Jones", "Thomas S. Powell"], "date": "1968", "abstract": "Several recent studies have indicated that the optic tectum or superior colliculus may serve more important and diverse functions than was formerly considered (Denny-Brown, 1962; Sprague and Meikle, 1965) and there is also evidence that the cortical connexions of the colliculus are significant in such functions (Sprague, 1966a, b). It has been established for some time that the superior colliculus receives a substantial projection from the neocortex (Meikle and Sprague, 1964), but relatively little attention has been paid to the organization that may be present in this system. The finding in the avian brain of a precise relationship between the representation of the retina upon the optic tectum and the origin of one group of tectal efferents (McGill, Powell, and Cowan, 1966), taken together with the well-ordered representation of the retina upon raises the question whether a comparably close relationship might not be present in the termination of the two distinct groups of afferents to the superior colliculus from the visual pathway-from the retina and from the visual cortex. As the architectonic subdivisions of the visual cortex (Otsuka and Hassler, 1962) have been shown to be functionally different (Hubel and Wiesel, 1965), and because there are separate representations of the retina in these areas, there is also the possibility that each of these areas projects independently upon the colliculus. A further aspect of the projection of the neocortex upon the tectum that should be considered is the relationship of the origin of those cortico-tectal fibres from 'non-visual' parts of the cortex to such functional areas as the auditory and somatic sensory areas and the motor cortex, and also the relationship of the termination of these fibres to that of the afferent fibres to the superior colliculus from ascending sensory pathways. The present investigation has been mainly concerned with these problems of the projection of the neocortex upon the superior colliculus in the cat (Garey, 1965), but as our material has also provided evidence on the cortical and other subcortical connexions of the visual area, certain of these findings have been included here because of their close interrelationship. The experimental results are presented and discussed in three sections, and the possible significance of these and other recent findings in the thalamocortical and mesencephalic connexions of the visual system will be finally considered in relation to the function of the superior colliculus.

Ryan Wagner", "Floyd Ratliff"], "date": "1956", "abstract": "In the compound lateral eye of Limulus each ommatidium functions as a single receptor unit in the discharge of impulses in the optic nerve. Impulses originate in the eccentric cell of each ommatidium and are conducted in its axon, which runs without interruption through an extensive plexus of nerve fibers to become a fiber of the optic nerve. The plexus makes interconnections among the ommatidia, but its exact organization is not understood. The ability of an ommatidium to discharge impulses in the axon of its eccentric cell is reduced by illumination of other ommatidia in its neighborhood: the threshold to light is raised, the number of impulses discharged in response to a suprathreshold flash of light is diminished, and the frequency with which impulses are discharged during steady illumination is decreased. Also, the activity that can be elicited under certain conditions when an ommatidium is in darkness can be inhibited similarly. There is no evidence for the spread of excitatory influences in the eye of Limulus. The inhibitory influence exerted upon an ommatidium that is discharging impulses at a steady rate begins, shortly after the onset of the illumination on neighboring ommatidia, with a sudden deep minimum in the frequency of discharge. After partial recovery, the frequency is maintained at a depressed level until the illumination on the neighboring receptors is turned off, following which there is prompt, though not instantaneous recovery to the original frequency. The inhibition is exerted directly upon the sensitive structure within the ommatidium: it has been observed when the impulses were recorded by a microelectrode thrust into an ommatidium, as well as when they were recorded more proximally in single fibers dissected from the optic nerve. Receptor units of the eye often inhibit one another mutually. This has been observed by recording the activity of two optic nerve fibers simultaneously. The mediation of the inhibitory influence appears to depend upon the integrity of nervous interconnections in the plexus: cutting the lateral connections to an ommatidium abolishes the inhibition exerted upon it. The nature of the influence that is mediated by the plexus and the mechanism whereby it exerts its inhibitory action on the receptor units are not known. The depression of the frequency of the discharge of nerve impulses from an ommatidium increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of the intensity of illumination on receptors in its vicinity. Inhibition of the discharge from an ommatidium is greater the larger the area of the eye illuminated in its vicinity. However, equal increments of area become less effective as the total area is increased. The response of an ommatidium is most effectively inhibited by the illumination of ommatidia that are close to it; the effectiveness diminishes with increasing distance, but may extend for several millimeters. Illumination of a fixed region of the eye at constant intensity produces a depression of the frequency of discharge of impulses from a nearby ommatidium that is approximately constant, irrespective of the level of excitation of the ommatidium. The inhibitory interaction in the eye of Limulus is an integrative process that is important in determining the patterns of nervous activity in the visual system. It is analogous to the inhibitory component of the interaction that takes place in the vertebrate retina. Inhibitory interaction results in the exaggeration of differences in sensory activity from different regions of the eye illuminated at different intensities, thus enhancing visual contrast.", "references": ["Spatial-Summation-of-Inhibitory-Influences-in-the-Hartline-Ratliff/5f655c2beb01bbed08908f8bffe776879a93e4bb", "Directional-Sensitivity-of-Single-Ommatidia-in-the-Waterman/f42e7b6954fbcbcfea40b04979afe8d1f84d436e", "Discharge-patterns-and-functional-organization-of-Kuffler/d11cf80190fcef83ac52086ee44876fda7507dfa", "Summation-and-inhibition-in-the-frog's-retina.-Barlow/5d977ee72fd0aaf8c2ac2808c9dd522cdef8b4b7", "Aspects-of-excitation-and-inhibition-in-the-retina.-Granit/3bf99aba831eedad3d968b0fc22aaf673591c3f3", "The-peripheral-origin-of-nervous-activity-in-the-Hartline-Wagner/69cd467212c1c3a5a3098afda659d5db6bf743cb"]},

Cynader"], "date": "1972", "abstract": "1. The superior colliculus has been studied in Siamese and normal cats by recording the responses of single tectal units to visual stimuli.2. The retinotopic organization of the superior colliculus has been compared in the two breeds. In the normal cat, the contralateral half-field is represented in the central and caudal part of the colliculus, and a vertical strip of the ipsilateral half-field, 15-20 degrees wide, is represented at the anterior tip. The Siamese cat superior colliculus receives an abnormally large projection from the ipsilateral half-field so that units with visual receptive fields which extend as far as 40 degrees into the ipsilateral half-field can be found. The area of the tectal surface devoted to the representation of the ipsilateral half-field is about twice as large in Siamese cats as in normal cats. The enhanced representation of the ipsilateral half-field in Siamese cats is reflected in a displacement of the vertical meridian and the area centralis on the tectal surface.3. The area centralis in the Siamese cat is located at about the same point on the tectal surface as would be occupied by a point in the visual field about 6-7 degrees contralateral to the area centralis in the normal cat. The smallest receptive fields in both breeds are located near the area centralis. The size of the receptive field for a tectal unit seems to be determined by the retinal location of the receptive field and not by the absolute position of the unit on the tectal surface.4. The receptive-field characteristics of tectal units show many similarities in the two breeds. The receptive fields of individual units consist of activating regions flanked by suppressive surrounds. Units respond well to stimuli of different shapes and orientation provided they are moving. The optimum stimulus for a given unit can be much smaller than the size of the activating region. About two thirds of the units studied in both breeds show directional selectivity. Most of the units studied in normal cats can be activated by stimulation of either eye, while in Siamese cats, 80% of the units studied can be driven only by the contralateral eye. A few monocularly driven units with two separated receptive fields have been observed in Siamese cats.5. In the left tectum of both breeds, units respond well to left-to-right stimulus movement. The reverse situation obtains in the right tectum. In Siamese cats, units located at the anterior tip of the tectum with their receptive fields located in the visual half-field ipsilateral to the tectum under study respond better to stimulus movement toward the area centralis than away from it. The preferred direction for a tectal unit seems to be determined by its tectal location rather than by the location of its receptive field in the retina.6. Visual cortex lesions in both breeds increase the responsiveness of tectal units to flashing spots and almost entirely remove the directional selectivity exhibited by tectal units, although units with asymmetric surrounds are still found. In normal cats, the lesions change the ocular dominance distribution, skewing it more strongly toward the contralateral eye. In Siamese cats, the ocular dominance distribution remains unchanged after a visual cortex lesion.7. The squint commonly exhibited by Siamese cats is regarded as a compensation for the anomalous retinotectal topography. It is suggested that, in the absence of an adaptive modification, the anomalous retinotectal projection would lead to mislocalization in Siamese cats just as it does in frogs and hamsters whose retinotectal projection has been experimentally altered. The convergent strabismus which Siamese cats commonly exhibit may be a cure for the abnormal retinal projections rather than a disease.", "references": []},

Brown"], "date": "1952", "abstract": "The condensation of retinene(1) with opsin to form rhodopsin is optimal at pH about 6, a pH which favors the condensation of retinene(1) with sulfhydryl rather than with amino groups. The synthesis of rhodopsin, though unaffected by the less powerful sulfhydryl reagents, monoiodoacetic acid and its amide, is inhibited completely by p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB). This inhibition is reversed in part by the addition of glutathione. PCMB does not attack rhodopsin itself, nor does it react with retinene(1). Its action in this system is confined to the -SH groups of opsin. Under some conditions the synthesis of rhodopsin is aided by the presence of such a sulfhydryl compound as glutathione, which helps to keep the -SH groups of opsin free and reduced. By means of the amperometric silver titration of Kolthoff and Harris, it is shown that sulfhydryl groups are liberated in the bleaching of rhodopsin, two such groups for each retinene(1) molecule that appears. This is true equally of rhodopsin from the retinas of cattle, frogs) and squid. The exposure of new sulfhydryl groups adds an important element to the growing evidence that relates the bleaching of rhodopsin to protein denaturation. The place of sulfhydryl groups in the structure of rhodopsin is still uncertain. They may be concerned directly in binding the chromophore to opsin; or alternatively they may furnish hydrogen atoms for some reductive change by which the chromophore is formed from retinene(1). In the amperometric silver titration, the bleaching of rhodopsin yields directly an electrical variation. This phenomenon may have some fundamental connection with the role of rhodopsin in visual excitation, and may provide a model of the excitation process in general.", "references": ["The-cataphoretic-mobility-of-visual-purple.-Broda-Victor/c72bda2445cfe58931407c4e5b7fe4fac0623241", "The-Interplay-of-Light-and-Heat-in-Bleaching-George/112feef56f4bf8eb2c7d2b090e1f120f9974439c", "The-Reversible-Heat-Denaturation-of-Eisenberg-Schwert/7b36461b9e777335411f87df836e261cdf04ac64", "The-chemistry-of-rod-vision.-Wald/2669b2744a760913f75aba1b49b363a97a224707", "Thiol-groups-of-biological-importance.-Barron/b2080aabcd772c986d263b977b1c5e1f28b8b40b", "Amperometric-determination-of-soluble-mercapto-in-Benesch/4f2e97a27ae3e699465e2043661a55703f2400c6"]},

If two groups of receptors are illuminated together the total inhibition they exert on a \"test receptor\" near them (decrease in the frequency of its nerve impulse discharge in response to light) depends on the combined inhibitory influences exerted by the two groups. If the two groups are widely separated in the eye, their total inhibitory effect on the test receptor equals the sum of the inhibitory effects they each produce separately. If they are close enough together to interact, their effect when acting together is usually less than the sum of their separate effects, since each group inhibits the activity of the other and hence reduces its inhibitory influence. However, the test receptor, or a small group illuminated with it, may interact with the two groups and affect the net inhibitory action. A variety of quantitative effects have been observed for different configurations of three such groups of receptors. The activity of a population of n interacting elements is described by a set of n simultaneous equations, linear in the frequencies of the receptor elements involved. Applied to three interacting receptors or receptor groups equations are derived that account quantitatively for the variety of effects observed in the various experimental configurations of retinal illumination used.", "references": ["Inhibitory-Interaction-of-Receptor-Units-in-the-Eye-Hartline-Ratliff/46475ba5e2d1bcfce0a56a2943ae6a55be6edf8a"]},

The authors show that gradual changes in logic can be achieved by the use of digital and analog properties of the natural prototype. A two-input, one-output neural network is described which gives a continuum of logic functions, including the analog equivalent for each of the sixteen binary functions. This multifunction response is accomplished by varying four interconnecting weighting elements which control the excitatory and inhibitory signals to the three neurons of the network. The logic capabilities of the basic network can be increased by replacing some of its fixed weights with variable ones and expanding the network to accommodate additional input signals. A simple procedure has been developed which automatically sets the weighting elements in a reinforcement learning process. Rapid convergence to the desired logic function is achieved. It is shown that human learning and behavior can be approximated by expanding the flexible neural logic technique to functional networks.", "references": []},

C. St. George"], "date": "1952", "abstract": "Rhodopsin, the pigment of the retinal rods, can be bleached either by light or by high temperature. Earlier work had shown that when white light is used the bleaching rate does not depend on temperature, and so must be independent of the internal energy of the molecule. On the other hand thermal bleaching in the dark has a high temperature dependence from which one can calculate that the reaction has an apparent activation energy of 44 kg. cal. per mole. It has now been shown that the bleaching rate of rhodopsin becomes temperature-dependent in red light, indicating that light and heat cooperate in activating the molecule. Apparently thermal energy is needed for bleaching at long wave lengths where the quanta are not sufficiently energy-rich to bring about bleaching by themselves. The temperature dependence appears at 590 mmicro. This is the longest wave length at which bleaching by light proceeds without thermal activation, and corresponds to a quantum energy of 48.5 kg. cal. per mole. This value of the minimum energy to bleach rhodopsin by light alone is in agreement with the activation energy of thermal bleaching in the dark. At wave lengths between 590 and 750 mmicro, the longest wave length at which the bleaching rate was fast enough to study, the sum of the quantum energy and of the activation energy calculated from the temperature coefficients remains between 44 and 48.5 kg. cal. This result shows that in red light the energy deficit of the quanta can be made up by a contribution of thermal energy from the internal degrees of freedom of the rhodopsin molecule. The absorption spectrum of rhodopsin, which is not markedly temperature-dependent at shorter wave lengths, also becomes temperature-dependent in red light of wave lengths longer than about 570 to 590 mmicro. The temperature dependence of the bleaching rate is at least partly accounted for by the temperature coefficient of absorption. There is some evidence that the temperature coefficient of bleaching is somewhat greater than the temperature coefficient of absorption at wave lengths longer than 590 mmicro;. This means that the thermal energy of the molecule is a more critical factor in bleaching than in absorption. It shows that some of the molecules which absorb energy-deficient quanta of red light are unable to supply the thermal component of the activation energy needed for bleaching, so bringing about a fall in the quantum efficiency. The experiments show that there is a gradual transition between the activation of rhodopsin by light and the activation by internal energy. It is suggested that energy can move freely between the prosthetic group and the protein moiety of the molecule. In this way a part of the large amount of energy in the internal degrees of freedom of rhodopsin could become available to assist in thermal activation. Assuming that the minimum energy required for bleaching is 48.5 kg. cal., an equation familiar in the study of unimolecular reaction has been used to estimate the number of internal degrees of freedom, n, involved in supplying the thermal component of the activation energy when rhodopsin is bleached in red light. It was found that n increases from 2 at 590 mmicro to a minimum value of 15 at 750 mmicro. One wonders what value n has at 1050 mmicro, where vision still persists, and where rhodopsin molecules may supply some 16 kg. cal. of thermal energy per mole in order to make up for the energy deficit of the quanta.", "references": ["The-photochemistry-of-vision-Wald/4ada6d471bf466a15b262252ad96601d334d19ec", "The-sensitivity-of-the-human-eye-to-infra-red-Griffin-Hubbard/7f00871b5452c3e8c98e1a0e908b47d22e93dbce"]},

Hartline", "Floyd Ratliff"], "date": "1957", "abstract": "The inhibition that is exerted mutually among the receptor units (ommatidia) in the lateral eye of Limulus has been analyzed by recording oscillographically the discharge of nerve impulses in single optic nerve fibers. The discharges from two ommatidia were recorded simultaneously by connecting the bundles containing their optic nerve fibers to separate amplifiers and recording systems. Ommatidia were chosen that were separated by no more than a few millimeters in the eye; they were illuminated independently by separate optical systems. The frequency of the maintained discharge of impulses from each of two ommatidia illuminated steadily is lower when both are illuminated together than when each is illuminated by itself. When only two ommatidia are illuminated, the magnitude of the inhibition of each one depends only on the degree of activity of the other; the activity of each, in turn, is the resultant of the excitation from its respective light stimulus and the inhibition exerted on it by the other. When additional receptors are illuminated in the vicinity of an interacting pair too far from one ommatidium to affect it directly, but near enough to the second to inhibit it, the frequency of discharge of the first increases as it is partially released from the inhibition exerted on it by the second (disinhibition). Disinhibition simulates facilitation; it is an example of indirect effects of interaction taking place over greater distances in the eye than are covered by direct inhibitory interconnections. When only two interacting ommatidia are illuminated, the inhibition exerted on each (decrease of its frequency of discharge) is a linear function of the degree of activity (frequency of discharge) of the other. Below a certain frequency (often different for different receptors) no inhibition is exerted by a receptor. Above this threshold, the rate of increase of inhibition of one receptor with increasing frequency of discharge of the other is constant, and may be at least as high as 0.2 impulse inhibited in one receptor per impulse discharged by the other. For a given pair of interacting receptors, the inhibitory coefficients are not always the same in the two directions of action. The responses to steady illumination of two receptor units that inhibit each other mutually are described quantitatively by two simultaneous linear equations that express concisely all the features discussed above. These equations may be extended and their number supplemented to describe the responses of more than two interacting elements.", "references": ["Spatial-Summation-of-Inhibitory-Influences-in-the-Hartline-Ratliff/5f655c2beb01bbed08908f8bffe776879a93e4bb", "Inhibition-in-the-Eye-of-Limulus-Hartline-Wagner/071924898b2c8a5977424e66287ff5673474db86"]},

Henry Thompson's early wishes to study medicine were opposed by his father who insisted on his entering the family business. Only at the age of 26, therefore, was he able to take up his life's work, becoming a medical student at University College Hospital. Here he came under the influence of Liston, some idea of which can be drawn from the fact that after Liston's sudden death more than 600 medical men and students attended his funeral at Highgate cemetery. As a house surgeon, one of Thompson's first dressers was Lister; it appears that it was he who suggested that Lister should go to Edinburgh to work with Syme. He gives a detailed account of medical student life of the time, including his enrolment as a special constable during the Chartist riots reminiscent of similar troubles in more recent times.", "references": []},

The arrangement of the columns is highly ordered; in the great majority of oblique or tangential microelectrode penetrations the preferred orientations of cells changed systematically with electrode position, in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Graphs of orientation vs. electrode track distance were virtually straight lines over distances of up to several millimeters; such orderly sequences were often terminated by sudden changes in the direction of orientation shifts, from clockwise to counterclockwise or back. The orientations at which these reversals occurred were quite unpredictable. Total rotations of 18% 360\u201d were frequently seen between reversals. In tangential or almost tangential penetrations orientation shifts occurred almost every time the electrode was moved forward, indicating that the columns were either not discrete or had a thickness of less than 25-50 p, the smallest order of distance that our methods could resolve. In penetrations that were almost perpendicular to the surface, the graphs of orientation vs. track distance were relatively flatter, as expected if the surfaces of constant orientation are perpendicular to the cortical surface. S tep wise changes in orientation of about 10\u201d could sometimes be seen in perpendicular penetrations, each orientation persisting through several clear advances of the electrode, suggesting a set of discrete columnar subdivisions. The possibility of some kind of continuous variation in orientation with horizontal distance along the cortex was not, however, completely ruled out. Occasionaliy a highly ordered sequence was broken by an abrupt large shift in orientation of up to 90\u201d. Shifts in ocular dominance occurred roughly every 0.25-0.5 mm and were independent of orientation shifts. In multiple parallel penetrations spaced closer than about 250 p the slopes of the orientation vs. track distance curves were almost the same; reconstruction of these penetrations indicated that the regions of constant orientation are parallel sheets. On crossing perpendicular to these sheets, a total orientation shift of 180\u201d took place over a distance of 0.51.0 mm. Column thickness, size of shifts in orientation, and the rate of change of orientation with distance along the cortex seemed to be independent of eccentricity, at least between 2 \u201d and 15\u201d from the fovea.

This system duplicates functionally the four image-feature-abstraction process found by Lettvin and co-workers in the frog retina.

Information presented to the receptors flows in a parallel mode through successive separate processing layers of the model; this information is preserved as it flows as a transformed \"map\" of the input image. Finally, the processed information is displayed as a spatial map of the four abstracted features of the input image, similar to the \"mapping\" performed in the brain of the frog. The model was constructed using neon-lamp/photoconductive (Ne-Pc) circuits on separate processing layers. These two elements serve the dual purpose of being principal circuit components as well as providing the interconnections between processing planes. In this manner, the inputs to a processing plane are photoconductive cells and and the outputs are neon lamps. This fabrication technique provides the advantages of easy access to individual components, rapid visual inspection of the operation of individual layers, and the simplicity of modifying the system by inserting or removing a particular layer.", "references": []},

The responses appear suitable to counteract involuntary changes of direction and altitude in free flight. Concerning the sensory system for visual flight control, the following was established: 1. Both eyes are functionally equal, and sensitive to pattern motion in any direction. 2. The motion detecting subunits possess a certain orientation on the eye surface, and discriminate between pattern motions that are progressive or regressive relative to this orientation. 3.

In the present study small lesions were made in single layers or pairs of layers in the lateral geniculate body, and the striate cortex was later examined with a Fink-Heimer modiikation of the Nauta method. We hoped to correlate the laminar distribution of axon terminals in the cortex with functional differences between layers, and to demonstrate the IVth-layer mosaic anatomically. After lesions in either of the two most dorsal (parvocellular) layers, terminal degeneration was found mainly in layer IVc, with a second minor input to a narrow band in the upper part of IVa. A very few degenerating fibers ascended to layer I. In contrast, lesions in either of the two ventral (magnocellular) layers were followed by terminal degeneration confined, apparently, to IVb, or at times extending for a short distance into the upper part of IVc; no degeneration was seen in layer IVa or in layer I. After a lesion confined to a single geniculate layer, a section through the corresponding region of striate cortex showed discrete areas or bands of degeneration in layer IV, usually 0.5-1.0 mm long, separated by interbands of about the same extent in which there was no terminal degeneration. When serial sections were reconstructed to obtain a face-on view of the layer-IV mosaic, it appeared as a series of regular, parallel, alternating degeneration-rich and degenerationpoor stripes. When a geniculate lesion involved both layer VI (the most dorsal, with input from the contralateral eye) and the part of layer V directly below (ipsilateral eye), the cortical degeneration, as expected, occupied a virtually continuous strip in layer IVc and the reconstructed face-on view of this layer showed a large confluent region of degeneration. In some of the reconstructions the cortical stripes seemed highly regular; in others there was a variable amount of cross connection between stripes. The stripes varied in width from 0.25 to 0.50 mm, and width did not seem to correlate with region of retinal representation. It is concluded that the long narrow stripes of alternating left-eye and righteye input to layer IV are an anatomical counterpart of the physiologically observed oculardominance columns. Because of this segregation of inputs, cells of layer IV are almost invariably influenced by one eye only. A cell above or below layer IV will be dominated by the eye supplying the nearest IVth layer stripe, but will generally, though not always, receive a subsidiary input from the other eye, presumably by diagonal connections from the nearest stripes supplied", "references": ["Organization-of-neurons-in-the-visual-cortex%2C-area-Lund/f042b89d7561d297910929b920fcb1e22f8854a3", "Short-axon-neuronal-subsystems-in-the-visual-cortex-Valverde/0602aeadc92f1502a9b7cb9bcd428146bc2530e8", "Selective-silver-impregnation-of-degenerating-axons-Wiitanen/ddb99b7e38400dea6de263904d4440120fdce653", "Two-methods-for-selective-silver-impregnation-of-in-Fink-Heimer/597e020348bc346ca5cd439aba03714aa99a8f18", "Spatial-and-chromatic-interactions-in-the-lateral-Wiesel-Hubel/8c26269a7ab8b42d59f5d125e3d283692bd37d71", "Receptive-fields%2C-binocular-interaction-and-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/6b4fe4aa4d66fecc7b2869569002714d91d0b3f7"]},

Westlake"], "date": "1970", "abstract": "A theory of brain functioning is proposed based upon an analogy to optical holographic processes. There are many properties which holography potentially offers to neurophysiology. Chief among these is the property of distributedness, which is displayed only by holographic processes. This property, an attribute of certain types of holograms, permits any small portion of the hologram to reconstruct the entire original scene recorded by the hologram. Because of this fact and other supporting evidence, neural versions of the holographic processes appear as most promising candidates for the coding of sensory and memory processes. It is demonstrated that mathematical models based on known elementary neurophysiological processes can embrace \u201cneural-holographic processes\u201d. This is done in terms of equations from optical holography which are discretized in space and time and are suitably transformed to account for the substitution of neural-pulse waveforms in the place of the sinusoidal oscillations involved in optical holography. The possible or probable differences between optical and neural holographic processes are then examined in detail. The various types of holographic processes are considered as to their suitability as paradigms for the neural processes. Fourier-transform holography appears to be the most suitable type for initial neural holographic models. An exploration of the possible correspondences or isomorphisms between the state space of the holographic process and the plausible state spaces of the neural coding process has been initiated. The most probable pairing at the level of the hologram appears to be: first, the correspondence of the electromagnetic oscillation phase with the neural interspike interval; and second, the correspondence of amplitude with neural impulse height. If necessary, the impulse height at the neural hologram could be restricted to binary values of pulse-no pulse, still permitting a coding of the complete intensity scale of \u201cgrays\u201d present in the reconstructed image of the original stimulus object. There is neurophysiological evidence indicating the possibility that the impulse height present in the stimulus object plane could be coded in terms of the impulse coherence-incoherence dimension, which would fit nicely into neural-holographic processes. Additional holographic properties are detailed and examined. When this is done collectively, it is concluded that: 1. Holography offers the only known truly distributed coding \u2014 thus implicitly obeying Lashley's laws in at least one formulation. 2. While translation and size-invariant pattern-recognition, one type of memory associativity, and three-dimensional, color and motion preserving imaging are capable of being accomplished in other ways, holography presents the only known method of doing so with the distributed characteristic. 3. Holography presents the only known way of producing one of the three types of image associativity. This particular type is a general type of associativity in which the basis of association is specific only in terms of the simultaneity of perceived events.

This particular type is a general type of associativity in which the basis of association is specific only in terms of the simultaneity of perceived events. This hypothesis is discussed in terms of previously-formulated wave interference theories of brain functioning. It is pointed out that the holographic point of view is basic to a complete discussion of any waveinterference theory. Some psychophysical and neurophysiological evidence for this hypothesis is examined. The principal evidence for such a hypothesis comes from: 0) recordings of single cell activity from Area 17 of the monkey; 1) animal brain lesion work (this work presents some of the evidence that visual and auditory processes are \u201cdistributed\u201d in at least one stage of the processing); 2) examination of brain-damaged human beings (it is pointed out that neural-holographic processes offer possible explanations formacular sparing andpolyopia); 3) general evidence for coherent pulse activity; and 4) some evidence of neural connectivity which would be suitable for neural holographic processes.

The term 'directionally selective' means that a unit gives a vigorous discharge of impulses when a stimulus object is moved through its receptive field in one direction (called the preferred direction), whereas motion in the reverse direction (called null) evokes little or no response. The preferred direction differs in different units, and the activity of a set of such units signals the direction of movement of objects in the visual field. In the rabbit the preferred and null directions cannot be predicted from a map of the receptive field showing the regions yielding on or off-responses to stationary spots. Furthermore, the preferred direction is unchanged by changing the stimulus; in particular, reversing the contrast of a spot or a black-white border does not reverse the preferred direction. Hubel & Wiesel (1962) thought that the directional selectivity of the cat's cortical neurons could be explained by the asymmetrical arrangement of on and off zones in the receptive field, and the simple interaction of effects summated over these zones, but the foregoing results rule out this explanation, at least in the rabbit's retina (Barlow & Hill, 1963). In the present paper we go on from this point to describe experiments which show, first, that directional selectivity is not due to optical aberrations of some kind and, secondly, that it is not a simple matter of the latency of response varying systematically across the receptive field. After these negative results we describe experiments upon the organization of directional selectivity within the receptive field, and upon its mechanism.

In higher mammals little is known about the degree to which nerve cells are specialized for handling these types of information. In a visual stimulus the importance of spatial attributes, and especially of dark-light contours, first became obvious with the discovery by Hartline (20 ) of lateral inhibition in the Limulus, a type of study that was extended to mammals when Kuffler (28) demonstrated t,hat the receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells in the cat are subdivided into a center and an opponent surround. The opponent principle, in which spatially separated excitatory and inhibitory regions are pitted against each other, has now been observed for retinal ganglion cells in the frog (1), the lizard (9), the rabbit (3), the rat (4), the ground squirrel (33), and the monkey (24). Similar effects have been seen in the lateral genie ulate bod .y and visual cortex in the cat (23, 25, 26), and also recently at these levels in the monkey. In 1958 De Valois and his collaborators (15) observed geniculate cells in the macaque monkey that were excited by one set of wavelengths and inhibited by another, making it apparent that in higher mammals the spectral composition of the stimulus was also an important variable. Similar opponent-color effects have since been described in the primate at the level of the retin .a1 ganglion cell (24), and in the visual cortex (34).

Access to memory traces is viewed in terms of a resonance metaphor.

Evidence is accumulated in parallel from each probe-memory item comparison, and each comparison is modeled by a continuous random walk process. In item recognition, the decision process is self-terminating on matching comparisons and exhaustive on nonmatching comparisons. The mathematical model produces predictions about accuracy, mean reaction time, error latency, and reaction time distributions that are in good accord with experimental data. The theory is applied to four item recognition paradigms (Sternberg, prememorized list, study-test, and continuous) and to speed-accuracy paradigms; results are found to provide a basis for comparison of these paradigms. It is noted that neural network models can be interfaced to the retrieval theory with little difficulty and that semantic memory models may benefit from such a retrieval scheme.", "references": ["List-length-and-the-time-course-of-recognition-in-Reed/04a8914c1c38a617332ca291271a765e76e9f8a7", "Accuracy-and-speed-strategies-in-scanning-active-Banks-atkinson/d0c8a0149cb736781883ec0f22fd7502e5574bce", "Ad-787-880-the-Interpretation-of-Reaction-Time-in-Pachella/1a7010e6b3c362edc6283ab87ebdb432bfad2c6e", "Speed-accuracy-trade-off-in-recognition-memory.-Reed/5d755f8ca4b61717a809c28a9d1e8b015c67b897", "Decision-latencies-in-short-term-recognition-Okada/762f13994a52cd3d3b0b6c3b66ab730e5db42070", "Serial-order-in-recognition-and-recall.-Corballis/21ccf98bbbddd3fa2ab04bfbc7b331d011d7e056", "High-speed-scanning-in-human-memory.-Sternberg/0f6a8be9de90de5206204d4e114efc0daaa2cd72"]},

Creutzfeldt", "H. C. Nothdurft"], "date": "1978", "abstract": "A method was developed to investigate transfer properties of neurons in the visual system using pictures of complex visual stimuli. The picture is moved over the receptive field of a neuron so that it can scan it along programmed lines. The activity of the neuron during the scanning procedure is presented in a two-dimensional dot display on scale with the original picture. By superposition of the stimulus and the transfer pattern, one can find out to which detail of a stimulus the neuron responds. Neurons in the first intracerebral relay of the visual system, the lateral geniculate body, reduce a complex stimulus, such as a photograph of a natural environment, to its contours. Cortical cells only respond to contours either of a limited or of a wider range of orientations (simple and complex cells, respectively). But the course of contours is only described by a continuous representation of these contours in the cortical map of the visual field. This is done by the simple cells, which have small receptive fields and thus a higher resolving power, whereas complex cells with their large receptive fields monitor the approximate location of a moving stimulus. The function of these two classes of neurons is discussed in terms of visual behavior, i.e., for fixation, hold, and binocular vergence movements (simple cells), and for detection of moving objects and motor command signals towards these objects (complex cells). These functions are an important condition for foveal vision which is the basis of perception in primates. An important function of orientation sensitivity of simple cells may be the binocular alignment of contours in binocular fusion and stereoscopic vision.", "references": ["Eye-Movements-and-Vision-Yarbus/b5a712dd07fa65d7ad60d6e791053c29448ecb97"]},

An executive routine is used to apply these subroutines to select a complete logic with a given performance and complexity. This logic consists of 39 to 96 AND gates connected to a shift register and a table look-up or resistance network comparison system. The methods were applied to the design of recognition logics for the 52 upper and lower case characters of IBM Electric Modern Pica type font and lower case Cyrillic characters scanned from Russian text. In both cases when the logics were tested on data different from that used to design the logics, the substitution rate was about one error per thousand. A single logic was designed to read two different Cyrillic fonts. For this design, an error rate of one error per hundred characters was observed. Several experiments are reported on a number of logics designed for typewritten data, and singleand two-font Cyrillic data.

The results have shown that there are two types of midget bipolar cell, here called the invaginating midget bipolar and the flat midget bipolar. Both types of midget bipolar are exclusive to a single cone. The invaginating midget bipolar has been found to fit a dendritic terminal process into every invagination in the cone pedicle base. The flat midget bipolar has dendritic terminals that make superficial contact on the cone pedicle base. There are twice as many dendritic terminals and points of contact with the cone pedicle on a flat midget bipolar top as compared with an invaginating midget bipolar top. These observations, together with light microscope counts of the numbers of the two types of midget bipolars, suggest that there are two midget bipolars per cone. The diffuse cone bipolar (the flat bipolar) also makes superficial contacts on the cone pedicle base, and serial sections have shown that a flat bipolar contacts about six cones. Rod bipolars connect exclusively to rods and their dendritic terminals always end as one of the central processes that penetrate the invagination. Horizontal cell dendrites end exclusively in cone pedicles and their axon terminals end in rod spherules. The point of contact with both the types of receptor is as the lateral elements of the invaginations. A single small horizontal cell contacts about seven cones and a large horizontal cell contacts about twelve cones. The numbers of contacts per cone pedicle decrease from the centre to the periphery of the horizontal cell's dendritic field, suggesting there is an overlap of four to six horizontal cells onto a single cone pedicle. The horizontal cell axon terminals are too numerous to assess in absolute numbers but there is only one terminal to a given rod spherule from any particular axon.", "references": []},

While intrinsic images are not segmented, they are distinctly easier to segment than the original intensity image. Segments can be detected by a general Hough transform technique. Networks of feature parameters are appended to the intrinsic image organization. Then the intrinsic image points are mapped into these networks. This mapping will be many-to-one onto parameter values that represent segments. This basic method is extended into a general representation and control technique with the addition of three main ideas: abstraction levels; sequential search; and tight counting These ideas are a nucleus of a connectionist theory of low 'eve and m'ermediate-level vision. This theory explains segmentation in terms of massively parallel cooperative computation among intrinsic images and a set of parameter spaces at different levels of abstraction.

The purpose of this paper is to identify some of these assumptions--mostly geometrical ones--by demonstrating how the theory and techniques which exploit such assumptions can provide a systematic shape-recovery method. The method consists of two parts. The first is the application of the Origami theory which models the world as a collection of plane surfaces and recovers the possible shapes qualitatively. The second is the technique of mapping image regularities into shape constraints for recovering the probable shapes quantitatively. Actual shape recovery from a single view is demonstrated for the scenes of an object such as a box and a chair.

This work was generalized to the detection of some analytic curves in grey level images, specifically lines, 14) circles 15) and parabolas/6) The line detection case is the best known of these and has been ingeniously exploited in several applications/7'89) We show how the boundaries of an arbitrary non-analytic shape can be used to construct a mapping between image space and Hough transform space. Such a mapping can be exploited to detect instances of that particular shape in an image. Furthermore, variations in the shape such as rotations, scale changes or figureground reversals correspond to straightforward transformations of this mapping. However, the most remarkable property is that such mappings can be composed to build mappings for complex shapes from the mappings of simpler component shapes. This makes the generalized Hough transform a kind of universal transform which can be used to find arbitrarily complex shapes. Image processing Parallel algorithms Hough transform Shape recognition Pattern recognition 1. I N T R O D U C T I O N In an image, the pertinent information about an object is very often contained in the shape of its boundary. Some appreciation of the importance of these boundary shapes in human vision can be gained from experiments performed on the human visual system, which have shown that crude encodings of the boundaries are often sufficient for object recognition (1\u00b0) and that the image may be initially encoded as an 'edge image', i.e. an image of local intensity or color gradients. Marr (~ 1) has termed this edge image a 'primal sketch' and suggested that this may be a necessary first step in image processing. We describe a very general algorithm for detecting objects of a specified shape from an image that has been transformed into such an edge representation. In that representation, sample points in the image no longer contain grey level information, but instead each sample point contains a magnitude and direction representing the severity and orientation of the local grey level change. Operators that transform the image in such a way are known as edge operators, and many such operators are available, all based on different models of the local grey level changes. Two of the most used are the gradient operator (for example, see Prewitt ~12)) and the Hueckel operator/t3J which model local grey level changes as a ramp and a step respectively. * The research described in this report was supported in part by NIH Grant R23-HL-2153-01 and in part by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Grant 78-4-15. Our generalized Hough algorithm uses edge information to define a mapping from the orientation of an edge point to a reference point of the shape. The reference point may be thought of as the origin of a local co-ordinate system for the shape. Then there is an easy way of computing a measure which rates how well points in the image are likely to be origins of the specified shape. Figure 1 shows a few graphic examples of the information used by the generalized Hough transform. Lines indicate gradient directions. A feature of the transform is that it will work even when the boundary is disconnected due to noise or occlusions. This is generally not true for other strategies which track edge segments.

On this view, the third (radial) dimension of cortical and thalamic structures is associated with a redundancy of circuits and functions so that reliable signal processing obtains in the presence of noisy or ambiguous stimuli. A mathematical model of simple cortical and thalamic nervous tissue is consequently developed, comprising two types of neurons (excitatory and inhibitory), homogeneously distributed in planar sheets, and interacting by way of recurrent lateral connexions. Following a discussion of certain anatomical and physiological restrictions on such interactions, numerical solutions of the relevant non-linear integro-differential equations are obtained. The results fall conveniently into three categories, each of which is postulated to correspond to a distinct type of tissue: sensory neo-cortex, archior prefrontal cortex, and thalamus. The different categories of solution are referred to as dynamical modes. The mode appropriate to thalamus involves a variety of non-linear oscillatory phenomena. That appropriate to archior prefrontal cortex is defined by the existence of spatially inhomogeneous stable steady states which retain contour information about prior stimuli. Finally, the mode appropriate to sensory neo-cortex involves active transient responses. It is shown that this particular mode reproduces some of the phenomenology of visual psychophysics, including spatial modulation transfer function determinations, certain metacontrast effects, and the spatial hysteresis phenomenon found in stereopsis.", "references": []},

Introduction Certain image properties, such as parallelisms, symmetries, and repeated patterns, provide cues for perceiving 3-D shape from a 2-D picture. This paper demonstrates how we can map those image properties into 3-D shape constraints by associating appropriate assumptions with them and by using appropriate computational and representational tools. We begin with the exploration of how one specific image property, \"skewed symmetry\", can be defined and formulated to serve as a cue to the determination of surface orientations. Then we will discuss the issue from two new, broader viewpoints. One is a class of the Affine-transformable patterns. It has various interesting properties, and includes skewed symmetry as a special case. The other is the computational paradigm of shape-from-texture. Skewed symmetry is derived in a second, independent way, as an instance of the application of the paradigm. Also, it is proven that the same skewed-symmetry constraint can arise from greatly different image conditions. This paper further claims that the ideas and techniques presented here are applicable to many other properties under a general framework of the shape-from-texture paradigm with the underlying meta-heuristic of non-accidental image properties. 2 . Skewed Symmetry In this section we assume the standard orthographic projections from scene to image, and a knowledge of the gradient space (see [5]). 2 . 1 . Def ini t ion, Assumption and Constra ints Symmetry in a 2-D picture has an axis for which the opposite sides are reflective; in other words, the symmetrical properties are found along the transverse lines perpendicular to the symmetry axis. The concept skewed symmetry is introduced by Kanade [3] by relaxing this condition a little. It means a class of 2-D shapes in which the symmetry is found along lines not necessarily perpendicular to the axis, but at a fixed angle to it. Formally, such shapes can be defined as 2-D Affine transforms of real symmetries. Figures 2-1 (a)(b)(c) show a few examples 2 . Stevens [6] presents a good body of psychological experiments which suggests that human observers can perceive surface orientations from figures with this property.

This paper, examining the nonsupervised case wherein the correct associations of the samples are unknown, demonstrates that it is possible under extremely general conditions to achieve effective adaptat ion without supervision.

This correspondence describes a program that demonstrates the feasibility of segmenting a scene into regions on the basis of velocity. A velocity measure is obtained by determining the amount of displacement of a reference feature between two pictures of the same scene. The pictures are taken only a short time apart so that the reference features can be correlated between the pictures on the basis of spatial position alone. This velocity measurement is associated with absolute reference points superimposed over the scene. It is assumed that all parts of an object have the same velocity measurement. Thus the velocity measurements associated with the reference points provide a means of classifying them as ``belonging'' to the same object. Points ``inside'' moving objects fall into either of two velocity measurement classes, which are easily correlated. Since the velocity of an object is independent of its color, a scene is segmented into regions that contain complete objects even if the objects are not monochromatic.", "references": ["Scene-Analysis-Using-Regions-Brice-Fennema/d28ebfd34b99aa866fe19023b7e6369aacd4d8c1"]},

What began as a study of engineering adaptive control problems involving dynamics, system and measurement noise, monitoring, transduction, and on-line instrumentation seems to have moved towards learning theory and methodology research that uses a refined plant/environment model as a vehicle of demonstration. An attempt is made to bring together, order, and briefly discuss many contributions in this field, bridging the era of earlier engineering practice to more recent artificial intelligence speculation. Both unimodal and multimodal strategies are discussed, together with problems arising in nonstationary environmental situations where information conservation, update, and retrieval are of considerable importance.

The algorithm divides the range data array into windows and fits approximating surfaces to those windows that do not contain discontinuities in range.

It uses tension splines which make the fitting patches locally adaptable to the shape of object surfaces.

Our computer programs represent objective methods that require a minimum of human assistance to compute cloud motions. Computer algorithms are described for matching the earth's disk, giving a global registration; a more precise local registration is then achieved by matching landmarks. Accurate registration is needed because the satellite cannot be given an ideal synchronous orbit and perfect attitude stability. We have experimented with landmark templates of sizes 10\u00d710 and 20\u00d720 picture elements, representing 25-mi and 50-mi squares. An initial coarse scan of the template suggests where to try a succession of fine scans. The disk matching and the template matching are combined in the complete subsystem for registration.

A computer can do, in a sense, only what it is told to do. But even when we do not know how to solve a certain problem, we may program a machine (computer) to Search through some large space of solution attempts. Unfortunately, this usually leads to an enormously inefficient process. With Pattern-Recognition techniques, efficiency can often be improved, by restricting the application of the machine's methods to appropriate problems. Pattern-Recognition, together with Learning, can be used to exploit generalizations based on accumulated experience, further reducing search.

The results presented in this report show that collinear and orthogonal image displacements undergo quantitatively similar raising of thresholds with saccades; thus, sac-cadic suppression of displacement is a quantitative but non-vectorial effect following the vectorial Helm-holtzian comparator. The relationship between saccadic suppression and the Helmholt~an frame~f-reference compu~tion was first suggested by Stark, Michael and Zuber (1969) and also discussed by Bridgeman, Hendry and Stark (1975). It is known from the work of Bischof and Kramer (1968). Matin, Matin and Pola (1970), and Matin (1974) that this computation is not simultaneous with the time course of the saccadic trajec-tory; indeed. objects of attention and fovea1 images are computed before other parts of the retinal image (Bischof and Kramer, 1968). Thus, saccadic suppression of image displacement appears to have functional correlates, in contrast to such various other phenomena as have been established to be suppressed during a saccade-light Our results speak to the issue of relating a functional role for non-vectorial saccadic suppression to dynamic or static mismatches in the vectorial Helm-holtzian comparison.

A. Sedgwick", "J. Holtzman"], "date": "1976", "abstract": "With accurate measurement of eye position during smooth tracking, comparison of the retinal and perceived paths of spots of light moving in harmonic motion indicates little compensation for smooth pursuit eye movements by the perceptual system. The data suggest that during smooth pursuit. the perceptual system has access to information about direction of tracking. and assumes a relatively low speed, almost irrespective of the actual speed of the eye. It appears. then, that the specification of innervation to the extraocular muscles for smooth tracking is predominantly peripheral. i.e. it occurs beyond the stage in the efferent command process momtored by perception. There are many reports in the literature that indicate inaccurate perception of the paths, extents and velocities of movement of targets that move with reasonably slow velocities on a homogeneous background. The earliest study that bears directly on the issues addressed in this paper is reported by Dodge (1903). Observers were instructed to track a spot of light moving with simple harmonic motion in a darkened room. The eyes engaged in predominantly smooth pursuit eye movements. Dodge reports that the perceived extent of movement of this tracked target was about one third of the perceived extent of motion of another untracked spot that moved simultaneously through an identical physical extent but 180 degrees out of phase with the tracked spot. From examination of the photographic records of the eye movements of his observers, Dodge concluded that the perceptual system had no information at all about smooth pursuit eye movements and that the perceived extent of motion was entirely determined by retinal slip. This interpretation was disputed by Carr (1907) and the controversy never seems to have been clearly resolved (Dodge, 1910; Carr, 1935). The issue of the extent to which the visual perceptual system compensates for smooth pursuit eye movements was not clearly and directly addressed again until Stoper (1967) investigated the problem. He briefly flashed. in succession. two lines while the observer\u2019s eye was engaged in more or less accurate smooth pursuit of a target on a homogeneous ground. The observer\u2019s judgments of the relative spatial location of these successive flashes indicate the extent to which this perception takes into account the actual movement of the eye. In his Experiment II, he used interflash intervals of up to 306 msec. His data show that the percep tion is almost completely determined by retinal location of the flashes, i.e. there is almost no compensation for smooth pursuit eye movements. He states: \u201cExpressed in terms of \u2018percentage of compensation. \u2019 The research on which this article is based was supported by Grant Number MH-16327 from the National Institute of Mental Health to Leon Festinger. \u2019 Present address: State College of Optometry, State University of New York. there is never more than 16:: compensation for the time intervals used here\u201d @. 112). In a further experiment, Stoper explored longer interflash intervals and reports that the compensation for the smooth pursuit eye movements increases as the interval increases. However, even at his longest interval of 1731 msec. the average \u201c/, of compensation for eye movement is only 649<. Moreover. at these longer rime intercals the author reports that the perceptions were very ambiguous. From the Stoper report one would come to the conclusion that the perceptual system takes relative]! little account of the actual eye movement when it is engaged in smooth pursuit. A similar conclusion was reached by Festinger and Easton (1974) in a more indirect manner. Following up an observation by Fujii (1943), they found that, when a target is moved on a homogeneous ground with uniform speed in a square path at a frequency of, say, 0.5 Hz with target speeds of IO\u2019-lY/sec, an observer who follows the target motion with his eyes (head restrained) perceives the path of the target as resembling a pincushion rather than a square. By recording the actual eye movements of observers while following such a target. they were able to compute the exact movement of the target on the retina and showed that the percep tion closely resembled the form of actual retinal path. This again implies that the perceptual system takes rather little account of actual smooth pursuit eye movements. There are other related reports in the literature that have been interpreted differently, usually in terms of principles of perceptual organization. Duncker (1919) mounted a light near the rim of a wheel and reports that moving the wheel in a dark room produces the expected perception of cycloid motion of the light. However, if a second light is also mounted at the hub of the wheel, the outer light is then seen to move in a circular path around the center light as the wheel moves. This kind of finding has been interpreted in terms of the dissociation of a common group motion from the total motion, resulting in the perception of the relative motions of the indTvidua1 lights. Johansson (1950) reports an excellent series of studies guided by this principle of the organization of perception.", "references": ["The-apparent-displacement-of-a-moving-light-spot.-Sumi/6587df83b14edb8c9af349dae2ae242e90a351e0", "Further-Observation-on-the-Path-of-Seen-Motion-of-Sumi/f754569f5ea74c565d046695ff3795df49562cf2", "Path-of-Seen-Motion-of-Two-Small-Light-Spots.-Sumi/00ccb3ed748555fd8b9b2e913594364e770966a4"]},

Emerson", "George L. Gerstein", "T Kallos", "Alan C Rosenquist"], "date": "1976", "abstract": "Subparalytic doses of s were given to three observers. Four major perceptions were reported: (1) displacement or repostttonmg,of the perceived visual world in the direction of a successfully executed eve movement: (2) jumping durmg a saccade; (3) mocmrent associated with drift of the eye; (4) increased effort associated with each eye movement. Paralytic doses of succinvlcholine were administered to a single observer. Three major perceptions were reported: (1) displacement in the direction of the intended eye movement without jumping: (2) a sensation that great effort was required to move the eye; (3)fading of the visual image due to effective retinal stabilization. Similar visual perceptions were observed when the eye was paralyzed with a local anesthetic: however, no fading or sense of effort was reuorted. No deficits in oattern vision (except for intermittent fading) were reported in any of the studies. When the normal eye is voluntarily moved to a new position, the optical image makes a transition on the retinal surface, yet our perception is of a stable visual and spatial world. Helmholtz (1867) first pointed out that if one pushes the globe with a finger the optical image also makes a transition on the retinal surface; however, unlike the normal perception described above, we perceive a displacement of visual space. This simple experiment led Helmholtz to conclude \u201cour judgments as to the direction of the visual axis are simply the result of the effect of will involved in trying to alter the adjustment of the eyes\u201d. That is, our perceptions of space must in part be calculated centrally from a motor outflow to the extraocular muscles rather than from a sensory feedback. Mach (1886), Hering (1879), Jackson and Paton (1909) all later produced evidence which further suggested that our sense of visual space is independent of extraocular sensory feedback. Sperry (1950) and Holst (1954) have called this central monitoring of extraocular motor outflow a \u201ccorollary discharge\u201d and \u201cefference copy\u201d, respectively. We will not discuss details here, since this literature has been extensively reviewed (MacKay, 1974, 1973; Dichgans and Bizzi, 1972; Evarts, 1971; and Merton, 1964). If a corollary discharge is in fact used centrally to calculate visual space, one would expect that extraocular paralysis would produce an illusory spatial displacement during voluntary eye movements. Several sources support this prediction. Clinically, for example, it is well known (Cogan, 1956; Jackson and Paton, 1909; Helmholtz, 1867) that pathological weakening or total paralysis of the extraocular muscles produces past pointing (spatial mislocalization). This past pointing is always in the direction of the attempted eye movement. Experimentally, \u2018Send reprint requests to: John K. Stevens. Dept of Physiology IG4. School of Medicine. University of Pennsylvania. Philadelphia. PA 19174, U.S.A. Kornmueller (1931) reported that weakening or paralysis of the extraocular muscles using a local anesthetic produced past pointing and illusions of spatial displacement. He stated that when \u201cglance intentions\u201d were attempted, a striking apparent displacement in the direction of the intended eye movement was perceived. Brindley and Merton (1960). Siebeck (1953, 1954) and West (1932) also described a similar apparent displacement in subjects given low doses of curare. Quite surprisingly, however, Siebeck (1953, 1954; Siebeck and Frey, 1953) found that when subjects were totally paralyzed with high doses of a neuromuscular blocking agent no illusion of spatial displacement was eDer reported. The subjects reported only that they had the subjective sensation that their eyes were paralyzed. It should be emphasized that these results are in direct contradiction to the motor outflow theory. The present series of experiments were designed to help resolve this contradiction. It is clear that to study the perceptions associated with extraocular paralysis it would be necessary to use all three forms of experimental paralysis discussed above. Accordingly, we produced: (1) partial paralysis with systemic low dose injections of curare to mimic the experiments of Brindley and Merton, West and Siebeck; (2) total paralysis using systemic injections of a neuromuscular blocking agent to replicate Siebeck\u2019s total paralysis study; and finally (3) retrobulbar blocks with local anesthetic similar to Kornmueller\u2019s procedure. Partial pnralysis METHODS Three of us served as observers in the low dose studies (RCE. ACR, JKS) and curare (624mg) was used as the paralyzing agent. Observations were always made during the induction period of the total paralysis studies and six experiments were carried out specifically for study of low dose effects. The same procedure and precautions described below in the total paralysis section were observed. Audio tapes were made of experiments, and transcripts were later typed.", "references": ["Suppression-of-visual-signals-by-rapid-image-in-the-Brooks-Holden/29a4c86c5d5e02ea5722b297d7254f004621ec84", "An-active-feedback-system-for-stabilizing-visual-Jones-Webster/6ed6990582f11623b247290ab16e7acdf84e5c71", "Inflow-as-a-source-of-extraretinal-eye-position-Skavenski/c55f8767c97a3470b2ab079e008c6b5d3cc4557d", "Elevation-of-Visual-Threshold-by-Displacement-of-MacKay/a000a6390130e352b09fb3ac79e9b600e92e0053", "Smearing-of-the-retinal-image-during-voluntary-eye-Mitrani-Mateeff/a547a2c52ffc8c7e225c666753882ffd56037358"]},

Introduction Picture processing by computer has been of considerable interest in computer science and robotics research. Most efforts in picture processing have been concerned with monochromatic pictures* But, as everyone realizes, actual scenes and pictures all contain color, and color information plays important roles in human perception and recognition of scenes and pictures. This suggests the usefulness of color information in picture processing by computer. In Ito(1973) we have discussed some basic problems and a conceptual framework for color picture processing by computer. We stated there the need of an experimental computer system for color picture processing and emphasized the importance of \"com-puter-oriented chromatics\".

Roecker", "A. Kiessling"], "date": "1975", "abstract": "Several methods f o r analyzing three dimensional scenes are discussed w i t h respect to t h e i r advantages and d i f f i c u l t i e s i n g e t t i n g r e a l three d i mensional coordinates. Stereo p i c t u r e processing and l i g h t i n t e r s e c t i n g methods are described along w i t h the r e s u l t of a new hardware system. On the example of a software system some special problems w i t h the a b s t r a c t i o n of scenes w i t h p r i m i t i v e obj e c t s are mentioned. A short look ahead to the f u t u r e closes t h i s paper. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n When designing a robot system, we have t o deal w i t h the problem of how the robot can get informat i o n about i t s environment. To get f u l l i n formation it seems to be necessary to design a v i s u a l input f a c i l i t y . Therefore there is the problem of how the automaton can get a three dimensional image of the world from v i s u a l i n f o r m a t i o n . This paper describes some systems, designed in the past, and t r i e s to p o i n t out t h e i r problems and d i f f i c u l t i e s . S t a r t i n g from these considerations, a new system i s presented w i t h which some of the w e l l known d i f f i c u l t i e s may be overcome. 2. Stereo p i c t u r e s For i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of stereo p i c t u r e s the system needs two p i c t u r e s of the same scene, taken from d i f f e r e n t viewing angles ( f i g . 1). Provided t h a t the two camera p o s i t i o n s P1 and P2 and the angles a and B are known, the three dimensional c o o r d i nates of the p o i n t B of the scene can be c a l c u l a ted. The main problem in stereo p i c t u r e processing i s t o d e f i n e two conjugate p o i n t s i n the stereo p a i r . A f t e r the d e f i n i t i o n o f one point i n the f i r s t p i c t u r e , the corresponding p o i n t i n the second p i c t u r e must be located. This can only be done i f the p i c t u r e p o i n t contains s i g n i f i c a n t i n formation, e.g. a corner p o i n t . This means t h a t we have t o deal w i t h two d i f f e r e n t problems: f i r s t , we have t o d e f i n e a s i g n i f i c a n t p o i n t i n a f i r s t p i c t u r e , and second, we have to recognize the corresponding p o i n t i n the second p i c t u r e . I n order t o solve the f i r s t problem we have t o apply timeconsuming preprocessing methods l i k e edge enhancement, e t c . The second problem can be solved by two dimensional l o c a l c o r r e l a t i o n methods f\\/. Because o f these d i f f i c u l t i e s , stereo methods are not used in f u l l y automatic systems since now. 3. L i g h t i n t e r s e c t i n g methods I n a l l methods described below, i l l u m i n a t i o n o f the scene is regarded as a p a r t of the recognizing system. Then a l l v i s i b l e p o i n t s o f a scene f i t w i t h a s t r a i g h t l i n e of l i g h t or w i t h an i l l u m i n a t i n g plane o f l i g h t . With t h i s information the three d i mensional coordinates o f a l l v i s i b l e p o i n t s can b e c a l c u l a t e d from t h e i r two dimensional coordinates i n the p i c t u r e . Using t h i s p r i n c i p a l several systems were designed. 3.1 Laser range f i n d e r The laser range f i n d i n g system uses a plane of l i g h t w i t h known o r i e n t a t i o n i n space f o r i l l u m i n a t i o n of the scene. The plane of l i g h t is generated w i t h a laser and a c y l i n d r i c a l lens. In such an i l l u m i n a t e d scene the camera is able to see only the i n t e r s e c t i n g l i n e of the l i g h t plane and the surface of the scene. The camera takes a comp l e t e p i c t u r e o f t h i s image and transmits i t t o the computer f o r f u r t h e r processing and e x t r a c t i o n of three dimensional coordinates of the i n t e r s e c t i n g l i n e . By moving the l i g h t source step by step across th whole scene, the process of t r a n s m i t t i n g p i c t u r e s and c a l c u l a t i n g s p a t i a l coordinates i s r e peated. I t i s evident t h a t there i s a large amount of data being t r a n s m i t t e d and processed, one p i c tu r e per l i n e , containing very l i t t l e i n f o r m a t i o n . Therefore the system is i n t o l e r a b l y timeconsuming, Agin and B i n f o r d /5/ need about 5 to 10 minutes per scene. 3.2 P a r a l l e l g r i d i l l u m i n a t i o n In order to get quick r e s u l t s from the system, one must t r y to take the complete information of the scene w i t h only one p i c t u r e , i . e . the scene has to be i l l u m i n a t e d w i t h a l l planes of l i g h t a t the same time. The simplest way to do t h i s is to use an opt i c a l g r i d , being projected cnto the scene. Processing of the p i c t u r e could be done by t r a c i n g the images of the i n t e r s e c t i n g l i n e s in the p i c t u r e . Computation of three dimensional coordinates can b e done c o r r e c t l y only, i f i t i s possible t o i d e n t i f y the images o f the l i n e s o f l i g h t i n the p i c t u r e by t h e i r mathematical equations. This problem causes some r e s t r i c t i o n s t o t h i s method: a) The camera has to be adjusted in such a way t h a t the p i c t u r e s contain p a r t s of the ground surface. b) Shadows, i n t e r r u p t i n g the image o f a l i n e , cause the system to stop t r a c i n g the l i n e . c) The camera p o s i t i o n must be chosen in such a way t h a t l i n e s , running on the top surface of an object,can be d i s t i n g u i s h e d from those running on the ground surface behind the obj", "references": []},

The performance is compared with that of a classical microwave receiver, i.e., one designed to optimize detection in a Gaussian channel. Such a receiver has the advantages of availability, simplicity, ease of implementation, and greater tolerance to slow photodetector response and is an obvious candidate for suboptimum detection. Procedures for calculating receiver performance in the Poisson regime by the tilted probability density technique are described and applied specifically to modulation schemes employing one or more subcarriers that are biphase or quadriphase modulated. Results indicate that the classical receiver falls noticeably short of the optimum only at or near 100 percent modulation, where it may require at worst up to 30 percent more light power in order to equal the maximum likelihood receiver. When modulation is incomplete, or when background radiation is significant, the difference in performance is generally much smaller.", "references": []},

For instance, it can be shown that this component can be completely canceled by an appropriate eye movement. Thus all exterospecific information is contained in the lamellar part, and this part is completely determined by the divergence of the parallax field. Thus the measure of expansion of the visual field as a function of direction of gaze is sufficient to provide all information available for egocentric orientation. It is further shown that the widely used focus of expansion, as introduced by Gibson, is not invariant against eye movements and does not (in general) correspond to extrema of the divergence.", "references": []},

Suppression is complete if eye movement is more than about three times larger than target displacement, and some suppression occurs even for target displacements of 4\u2019. These results can be interpreted with the addition of a threshold element to the algebraic sum of the corollary discharge and the visual signal. The common observation that one\u2019s own rapid eye movements (saccades) are not visible in a mirror has never been explained and raises the more general question of the perception of object displacement during saccades. The perceptual stability of the visual world despite saccades has classically been explained by postulating two parallel discharges from eye movement centers: one to the extraocular muscles, and a corollary discharge (CD) to the visual system to accurately subtract the effects ofeye movement from the internal (as opposed to retinal) representation of the visual world (Helmholtz. 1867; Sperry, 1950; von Hoist and Mettelstaedt, 1950). Difficulties arise for CD theories if object displacement is not detected for any displacement of a target in the world during a saccade creates a retinal target displacement different in magnitude from that of the CD, so that the target displacement should be detected. The experiment reported here shows, however, that target displacement during saccades often goes undetected quantifying the mirror observation.", "references": ["Suppression-of-visual-evoked-responses-to-flashes-Chase-Kalil/572210e76dba98e5a691e9da70395ed73d10954a", "Scanpaths-in-saccadic-eye-movements-while-viewing-Noton-Stark/8e6924b3431138c5a916451bbff67ce92edf1d19", "Elevation-of-Visual-Threshold-by-Displacement-of-MacKay/a000a6390130e352b09fb3ac79e9b600e92e0053", "Inhibition-of-visual-evoked-responses-to-patterned-Gross-Vaughan/d2c5f53ea062adc06296a78e8f1991080c951ce2", "Visual-threshold-changes-resulting-from-spontaneous-Beeler/e4ae570ff3328846608b17e7eb914aa8cba04e23", "Saccadic-suppression%3A-elevation-of-visual-threshold-Zuber-Stark/c5514995488d1735f545693a7feb9cee4a57718c"]},

Bes ides, the c o n s t r a i n t o f the p o s i t i o n , the arrangement and the shape of the ob jec t s are necessary f o r the measurement of their 3-dimensional positions and sizes. In order to measure the 3-dimensional position direct ly, a range finder has been studied, and two typical methods have been developed up to now. One is to project a spot l ight and detect i ts (5) reflecting l ight , and the other is based on the stereoscopic view. The former takes a long time to got the range of many points of objects because it requires the rotation of a spot beam for the measurement of each point. The latter requires a great deal of calculation to determine the corresponding points of the two pictures. The method presented here employs a vert ical s l i t projector and a TV camera to pick up i ts reflected l ight . By rotating a projector from the le f t to the right, the distance of many points in a f ield of view is obtained quickly. 2. Construction of a range finder The range finder employed in this study projects a l ight beam through a vertical s l i t in a projector at a constant distance from a TV camera as shown in F ig . l . While the projector is rotated, pictures are sampled by a TV camera at predetermined instances and the information related to each picture and a corresponding s l i t beam angle is stored. If each position of a s l i t in the picture is determined from a stored picture, then i ts 3-dimensional position can be calculated by means of trigonometry. The input of picture data is controlled by a computer as shown in Fig.2, and the video signal of each picturee is converted into (7) a digi tal signal by a preprocessor. This preprocessor divides the frame of a camera into 256 x 256 picture elements, Session No. 3 Scene Analysis II General Papers 81 and 64 x 64 elements are sampled in one scanning time. 3. Recocrmtion of polyhedrons The recognition procedure of polyhedrons based on a set of picture data and s l i t beam angles involves ( l ) determination of s l i t positions, (2) composition of lines, (3) composition of planes , (4) determination of the position of planes, and (5) composition of polyhedrons. In ( l ) (3), only picture data are used; in (4), the 3-dimensional position of the plane is obtained with s l i t beam angles. In (5), the objects are recognized based on the interrelation of planes. There is an alternative process of estimating the distance to the surface for each point and then analyzing the two dimensional f ield of distance to find surface. This method takes a long time for calculation of the distance for evely point. The process presented here calculates only the end points of lines to determine the psoition of planes. Each procedure is described in detail in the fo i l owing. (1) Determination of s l i t positions Each picture corresponding to a s l i t beam angle is stored in binary form where each picture element is 1 if the l ight intensity is above the threshold, and 0 otherwise. At f i r s t this picture is smoothed to eliminate the effect of noise caused by a vidicon camera or a preprocessor. Let the binary picture element be denoted by the mutrix element C( i , j ) , the output of smoothing operation C ' ( i , j ) is the majority of C ( i , j ) , C(i, j l ) and C( i , j+ l ) . By examining elements C ' ( i , j ) along the j th row, from among the sequences whose element successively takes value 1, the longest sequence is selected, and i ts position is established as the center of the sequence. This operation is carried out for every j, and then a s l i t position is denoted by the sequence of points I ( j ) . Fig.4 i l lustrates the sequence of points for each s l i t position of a picture. (2) Composition of lines If polyhedrons are placed in the background that consists of planes, a projected s l i t image is generally composed of lines as shown in Fig.5. In the image, a discontinuous terminal point of a line corresponds to a discontinuous boundary point of a plane and an intersection of two lines corresponds to a boundary point of two adjacent planes. In the f i r s t step for composition of lines from the sequence of s l i t points I ( j ) , discontinuous points are found and each set of l ( j ) whose elements are regarded as continuous is l is ted. A set of s l i t points {T(j), J=J s~ Je} constitutes a line or several adjacent lines. The next step is , therefore, to find the number of lines included in a set of s l i t points, and the terminal points and the equation of each l ine. At f i r s t a sequence of I ( j ) which constitutes a line segment is found. This sequence {I ( j i ) , J i=J_ 3 ,J_ 2 , j_ 1J o , J-1' J2' J3} must satisfy the following two equations: 82 Session No. 3 Scene Analysis II General Papers line is found. This algorithm is , as shown in Fig.6, to track the s l i t point, sequentially correcting the equation of a l ine. Fig.7 shows the result of the tracking and Fig.8 shows the lines thus obtai ned. (3) Composition of planes This operation groups linos obtained in (2) into classes whose element constitutes a plane. If s l i t images are sampled at constant time intervals, then the images of the sl i ts projected on the same plane form nearly parallel lines at constant intervals. Adjacent lines which correspond to s l i t beam angles are grouped into the same class, and then the lines in a class are again d i vided into different classes based on their intervals. After this operation, each class of lines constitutes a plane. The principle of the above two classif i cation algorithms is about the same as that of tracking in (2); i .e. , at f i rs t find the segment of a plane and then examine the next line if it belongs to the plane unti l the boundary line of the plane is found. (4) Determination of the positions of planes A class of lines obtained in (3) does not precisely compose a plane because of errors in various phases of the procedure. In this stage, the 3-dimensional position of each plane is calculated from the class of lines and their corresponding s l i t beam angles. Let a plane consist of n lines and the equation of the plane be denoted by bx + c = 0. Let L(x., b, c) denote the Euclidian distance between the plane and a point x. on the i th l ine, then L(x i , b, c) can be easily calculated. Let the integral of L (x., b, c) be defined as (3) The coefficients of the equation of the plane, b and c, are determined by the least squares method so that the following value J is minimized.", "references": []},

The effects of fatigue could explain some of the variations between and spread within published data for velocity vs amplitude of human saccadic eye movements. Measuring the resistance to eye movement fatigue could become either a common clinical tool for diagnosing specific or general disease states, or a research tool for studying dyslexia or fatigue.", "references": ["Closely-spaced-saccades.-Bahill-Bahill/a0944b0d8d2ff54dee2531e75d8767400422d1ed", "Dynamic-overshoot-in-saccadic-eye-movements-is-by-Bahill-Clark/994da066f23f7a0d66bbc655e45fe62e416ab95e", "The-Main-Sequence%2C-A-Tool-for-Studying-Human-Eye-Michael-Clark/ffe8300895d53afed0900d7b9c9f58a47239e12e", "Some-examples-of-programmed-limb-movements.-Brooks/2e22613b3c10352ef8c644599ef4d7c475d8636d", "Velocity-characteristics-of-normal-human-saccades.-Boghen-Troost/197a11149876a1dee9fad578e5c6b7485396aef9", "A-quantitative-approach-to-habituation-and-to-of-of-Harris-Stark/8337e3aa4c2f33ccbda29c68bef58b3771823848", "Corrective-movements-following-refixation-saccades%3A-Weber-Daroff/3d35bdfa2dfba5f4e38b7aa3c35ce6df048bafcb", "Saccadic-eye-movements-in-myasthenia-gravis.-Metz-Scott/329832e1c3e14e2b9ed843431cd39edf30802a72"]},

Due to the global approach, greater flexibility and adequacy in the particular problem is achieved. The relation between the structure of the figure of merit and the complexity of the optimization process is then discussed.

The hexagonal tessellation is preferred because it removes the connectivity ambiguity present in the square or checkerboard tessellation. Golay transforms also may be applied to multilevel or \"gray\" images by encoding such images as a registered stack of binary image planes. The general Golay transform creates a new binary image (the output image) from as many as three stacked input images. Simpler Golay transforms merely alter the binary pattern contained in a single image plane, i.e., the same plane acts as both input and output. Because it is slow and cumbersome to perform Golay transforms using a general-purpose computer, fast special-purpose computers have been built for this purpose which may be programmed in a new image processing language called Glol (Golay logic language). It has been found, using both synthetic images as well as images taken from the real world, that Golay transforms are useful in feature enhancement and extraction.

Zucker", "Azriel Rosenfeld"], "date": "1977", "abstract": "Two methods are introduced for reducing additive noise in approximately piecewise constant images. In the first method, the correct gray level of a point P is estimated by a weighted average of the gray levels of P's immediate neighbors. To assign these weights for a given P so that the local averaging operation does not blur the image, the presence of any edges or lines passing through P's neighborhood must be determined. For example, when an edge is present, only those points on P's side of the edge should be used. In general, the distribution of gray levels in P's neighborhood will suggest many possible line and edge configurations which can be used to compute the weight distribution for the averaging operation. The averaging is performed in parallel over the entire image and is iterated for additional smoothing. The second method is a relaxation labeling formulation which can be psed in cases of more severe noise. Each point is now assigned a vector of probabilities over its allowable gray level set. These probabilities are updated as weighted averages of the gray level probabilities at neighboring points. Once again the presence of lines and edges determines how the contribution from each neighboring point is weighted.

A periodic organization has also been demonstrated for the intrinsic connections in layer 4B, which are apparently in register with the supragranular periodicities, although separated from these by a thin unlabeled region. The 4B lattice is particularly prominent in squirrel monkey, extending for 2-3 mm from an injection. In both layers, these intrinsic connections are demonstrated by orthogradely and retrogradely transported HRP and seem to reflect a system of neurons with long horizontal axon collaterals, presumably with arborizations at regularly spaced intervals. The intrinsic connectional lattice in layers 2 and 3 resembles the repetitive array of cytochrome oxidase activity in these layers; but despite similarities of dimension and pattern, the two systems do not appear identical.

The stripes were reconstructed on a representation of the flattened cortical surface by two independent techniques: one used computer graphics, and the other was the manual unfolding procedure of Van Essen and Maunsell (VanEssen, D. C., and J. H. R. Maunsell (1980) J. Comp. Neurol. 191: 255-281). The two reconstructions differed in many details of the pattern but were in agreement on its general features. As described in earlier studies, the stripes formed a system of parallel bands, with numerous branches and islands. They were roughly orthogonal to the V1/V2 border throughout the binocular segment of the cortex. In the lateral part of the operculum, where the fovea is represented, the stripes were less orderly than elsewhere. In the calcarine fissure the stripes ran directly across the striate cortex from its dorsal to its ventral margin. In the far periphery the stripes for the ipsilateral eye became progressively narrower, eventually fragmenting into small islands at the edge of the monocular segment. The overall periodicity (width of a left- plus right-eye pair of stripes) averaged 0.88 mm but decreased by a factor of about 2 from center to periphery. This decrease was not accounted for solely by shrinkage of the ipsilateral eye stripes. The flattened cortical reconstruction was transformed back into visual field coordinates, using information about visual field topography obtained from the detailed mapping study of Van Essen et al. (Van Essen, D.C., W.T. Newsome, and J.H.R. Maunsell (1984) Vision Res. 24: 429-448), as well as from more limited mapping done in the same monkey that was used for the reconstruction. In the transformed map, the stripes increased in width about 40-fold from the fovea to the far periphery. As deduced previously (LeVay, S., D. H. Hubel, and T. N. Wiesel (1975) J. Comp. Neurol. 159: 559-576; Hubel, D. H., and D. C., Freeman (1977) Brain Res. 122: 336-343), there were portions of the map in which the stripes followed curves approximating isoeccentricity lines, but this relationship was not very exact or consistent. The pattern of stripes appears to be more meaningfully related to the geometry of the cortical surface.

The text i s English language text appearing in scientific and technical documents. The picture sources are the largely schematic pictures that occur in the same class of documents. However, the discussion is broadened slightly to include other picture sources. For a tiny fragment of English, the paper shows how the syntactic structure of text may be described, and then goes on to suggest that a similar analysis may be performed on the class of pictures under study. The description of these two kinds of information sources with a single class of descriptive techniques i s suggested as an alternative to the synthetic approach in which artificial languages are specified and then learned and used. The major reason for doing syntactical analysis of such sources discussed here i s that several information processing operations, amounting to the interpretation of the information sources looked upon as languages, can be done by the technique of syntax direction which uses the results of syntactic analysis to mediatq subsequent processes for manipulating the information tokens. The paper concludes with an illustration of an algorithm for matching the sentences given by a simple grammar against the class of simple pictures which these sentences purport to describe. N THIS PAPER w e shall consider as a single class of information sources that which is usually considered t o be two or perhaps more disjoint classes of information for information processing purposes.

This belief is based on the demonstration of direct anatomic connections from this area to all the oculomotor nuclei (ZZ), on the severe and permanent disruption of eye movement that results from focal lesions placed in this area (3), and on the shortlatency eye movements that are evoked by electrical stimulation in this area (6). Single-neuron recordings in this or closely adjacent brain stem areas (5, 7, 8, 15, 24) have revealed several categories of neural activity that is closely and differentially correlated with various types of eye movemen ts. These previous studies have either been conducted on animals without the primate\u2019s repertory of eye movements (7, S), have been brief, qualitative reports concerned only with segregating the units by type (5, 24), or have not considered unit behavior during smooth pursuit or vestibularly driven movements (15). It has been previously shown that each oculomotor neuron participates in all the types of primate eye movement (21). Therefore, in working out the details of the supranuclear organization of the oculomotor system the question that remains to be clarified is how and at what level signals from the various separate eye-movement-generating subsystems are brought together.

Such evoked movements have been reinvestigated by many others (e.g., 8, 19, 21, 28) and most recently by Cohen et al. (5). There is not much agreement among the many studies concerning which areas of the cerebellum produce eye movements when stimulated and the nature and direction of those movements. The only agreement is that stimulation of the vermis, lobes VI and VII, evoke ipsilateral, horizontal eye movements (5, X7, 18, 20, 21). The most controversial results relate to stimulation of the hemispheres. A variety of eye movements have been reported that included ipsilateral, horizontal movements (20), nystagmus, contralateral or up movements (8), and rotatory up movements (11). Controversial results were also obtained from cerebellar nuclei stimulation. Stimulation of some areas of the cerebellum were considered to evoke eye movements without any apparent correlation between the site stimulated and the direction of the evoked movement (5, 8, 9, 18, 19). Often, the results from only one or two sites in a given cerebellar subdivision were reported rather than a thorough local exploration. The fact that there is not a single cerebellar structure from which stimulation by one or another investigator did not evoke eye movements would imply that they are represented everywhere in the cerebellum. Eye movements were not the primary interest of most investigators (11, 18, 19, 21, 25, 28); the eye movements were not studied in detail and descriptions of them were qualititative and subjective.

All interareal connections are reciprocal. Ipsilaterally, such connections exist between areas 17 and 18, 17 and MT, 18 and 19, 18 and MT, and 19 and MT. In addition, areas 18, 19, and MT receive association fibers from the ipsilateral frontal eye field; when combined with previous findings, these results indicate the existence of reciprocal connections between area 18 and the frontal eye field and between area MT and the frontal eye field. Each of areas 18, 19, and MT. Area 17 has only weak callosal connections. Both the ipsilateral and the contralateral connections are topographically organized such that they obey a hodological principle of visuotopic connectivity: that is, only representations of the same part of the visual field are interconnected. With regard to layers of origin, the callosal neurons of these visual areas conform to the general concept of corticocortical fibers arising from supragranular layers in that most of them are located in layer IIIb; only a few of them reside at the junction between layers V and VI. On the other hand, for all the visuocortical connections investigated, the anteriormost area of a reciprocally interconnected pair has its association neurons located predominantly in the infragranular layers while the posteriormost area has its association neurons located primarily in layer III. All callosal fibers and most association fibers arise from pyramidal cells. The callosal cells are larger and reside at a deeper level in layer III than neurons with ipsilateral corticocortical connections. However, some of the association cells at the junction of layers V and VI in area 17 which project to area MT are relatively large and may include the solitary cells of Meynert; but medium-sized pyramidal cells also participate in this projection. In area 17, some association neurons in layers IIIb and IIIc which project to area 18, as well as some in layer IIIc which project to area MT, are most likely stellate cells. Several different patterns of cell groupings were observed for the central representation interconnections. Neither ipsilateral area MT nor any of the contralateral visuocortical areas had multiple groupings of labeled neurons.

In contrast to AChE, the pseudocholinesterases have been assigned no certain function in neural transmission and initially were thought to occur mainly in neuroglia, Schwann cells and vascular endothelia1,4. Pseudocholinesterase activity has since been found in neurones and neuropil in several brain regions1,4,5, however, and in the superior cervical ganglion, BuChE has been localized to postsynaptic membranes6 and shown to exist in stable molecular forms corresponding to each of the known molecular forms of true cholinesterase7. These observations have led to the alternative interpretations that the pseudocholinesterases are either metabolic precursors of AChE8 or that they have functions closely related to those of AChE5,7 while being independent of true cholinesterases. We have directly compared the distributions of BuChE and AChE in the central visual pathway of the primate, a neural system in which anatomical and functional compartmentalization is well known9. We demonstrate here that the histochemical localization of Pseudocholinesterase rivals that of AChE in terms of specificity, and that BuChE is independent of AChE both in its normal distribution in the lateral geniculate body and striate cortex and in the response it shows to eye enucleation. We conclude that BuChE or its endogenous substrate may be a neuroactive substance in the primate brain.", "references": []},

They can be used to extract offectively the \"syntax\" of the dictionary while requiring very modest amounts of storage. A computationally feasible procedure is described which allows the accuracy requirements of the character recognizer to be relaxed if it is followed by a contextual postprocessor. The modified recognition system is allowed to output several alternatives for each character, while the postprocessor selects the proper string of characters by having access to both the dictionary and the dictionary syntax.

In the present study in the macaque we found that the patches were arranged in rows spaced about 350 \u00b5m apart. When one eye was injected with tritiated proline the rows of patches in layers II and III lay in register with the ocular-dominance bands seen autoradiographically in layer IVc. Removing one eye caused the patches in every other row to shrink and blanch. The rows of patches are therefore centred on the ocular dominance columns. Regions labelled by 2-deoxyglucose autoradiography after stimulating one eye with black-and-white stripes in all orientations consisted of rows of patches that lay in register with the cytochrome oxidase patches in every other row. On stimulating monkeys with stripes of a single orientation, the deoxyglucose-labelled regions formed a lattice that included the cytochrome oxidase patches but was more extensive.

After removing the Golgi precipitate from boutons of two cells in the cat, small pleomorphic and flattened vesicles were found in the boutons. Earlier suggestions that double bouquet cells make synapses preferentially with spines of apical dendrites could not be confirmed. Out of 66 boutons in area 17 of the cat, 86.4% formed synapses with dendritic shafts, many of them belonging to nonpyramidal cells, 9% with perikarya of nonpyramidal cells, and only 4.6% with spines. Out of 19 synapses examined in area 18, 74% were contacting dendritic shafts and the rest contacted spines. In the monkey 60% of a total of 35 double bouquet cell synapses made synapses with dendritic shafts. A different type of double bouquet cell with densely spiny dendrites is also described in layer IV of the monkey striate cortex. This neuron formed asymmetrical synapses.

It would therefore be of value to delineate the intracortical projection of the axons of different types of GABA-releasing neurones in regions of cortex where the receptive field properties of the neurones, and their modification by GABA antagonists, are well known. The selective high-affinity uptake of labelled GABA has been useful in delineating GABAergic systems12: recently, it has been shown that exo-genous 3H-GABA is specifically taken up and transported retrogradely by axons of neurones thought to be GABA-ergic13,14.

Different kinds of binocular interactions were observed. 3. Most neurons (84%) were sensitive to location of the stimulus in depth. Four types of depth-sensitive cells were recognized: a) tuned excitatory neurons, the most common type, that gave excitatory responses over a narrow range of depth about the fixation distance often with inhibitory flanks nearer and farther, and that typically received a balanced binocular input; b) tuned inhibitory neurons whose responses were largely suppressed by stimuli at or close to the plane of fixation; c) near neurons, which responded well to stimuli in front of the fixation plane and were suppressed by those behind it; d) far neurons, the opposite of near neurons. The last three types of depth cells were usually ocularly unbalanced. Peaks and steps of depthsensitivity profiles occurred at or close to the fixation distance (within t 0.4O of disparity), whereas the total range of binocular interaction, even for a single cell, could extend to more than t lo of disparity. 4.

The projections from a single cortical locus are segregated into several patches of labeled terminals in layers III-IV, which form bands in consecutive sections. Fields of distribution of these bands from two sites of area 17 may completely overlap, when they arise from neighboring regions, or may partially overlap, when they arise from more separated regions. The latter show a retinotopical order in these connections and, consequently, of area STS itself: central visual field is lateral and ventral in STS to peripheral visual field, and upper visual field is ventral and medial to lower visual field. Connections from area 17 to area MT in owl monkey were analyzed in a comparative study. Results show that these connections are also highly segregated into bands, and that those arising in separate, but neighboring regions of 17, may greatly overlap in MT. The retinotopy of these connections was not studied, however. The similar divergent distribution of area 17 connections to STS and MT, and the similarity of the topography of STS connections and of the known retinotopy of area MT, are considered as elements of homologies between these areas.

The material has been analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by means of a computer program which permits cells to be rotated so as to display their three-dimensional architecture. Nine non-pyramidal types are identified of which one is a rare giant cell and another, forming a major proportion of the cells in layer VI, is considered to be a modified form of pyramidal cell. Of the other seven types, two have horizontally distributed axons, one essentially confined to layer II, the other sending long (up to 1 mm) branches anter-posteriorly through all layers. Two types have vertical axons. One, corresponding to the \"double bouquet dendritique\" cell of Cajal, is mainly situated in layer II or the upper part of layer III and has a cluster of large axon branches which descend to layers IV and V and which enclose and terminate on the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. The other type is the only non-pyramidal cell which has a relatively high concentration of dendritic spines in the adult animal. Its soma lies in layer IV and it has several strongly recurrent, thick axonal branches ascending to layer II, also enclosing the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. The dendritic field is not truly stellate but is drawn out into a pronounced ascending tuft which ascends into layer IIIb. The cell thus resembles a \"star-pyramid\" of Lorente de N\u00f3. Nevertheless such cells have many features, notably the distribution of their axons and the distribution of dendritic spines which are identical to those of the well-known \"spiny stellate\" cell of the visual cortex. Conversely the same features both in these cells and in the spiny stellate cells of the visual cortex (which were also eamined) differ markedly from those of small pyramidal cells with somata of similar dimensions. The three remaining non-pyramida cell types have locally ramifying axons which appear to terminate predominantly on pyramidal cells. In one, the axon forms smoothly curving arcades in layer III, in another it is intensely tangled in layer IV and in the third it is bush-like in layers II-IV. continued.", "references": []},

One type, the opposed movement complex and opposed movement hypercomplex cells, responded to two edges at a given orientation moving towards or away from each other within the receptive fields. These cells were driven either monocularly or binocularly, but when binocularly driven the cells responded in an identical manner to stimulation of each eye, thus suggesting that such cells must receive a double, and opposed, input from each eye. The other type of cell, always binocularly driven, responded to movement in opposite directions on the two retinas, thus suggesting that such cells must receive diametrically opposite connexions from the two eyes.3. Long penetrations made to study the manner in which such cells were grouped together in the cortex revealed that they were arranged in small groups or clusters, separated from each other by the common directionally selective cells so prominently present in this area.

Richards"], "date": "1975", "abstract": "Depth discrimination and perceived depth magnitude (indicated by a manual pointing response) were studied for disparities from 0.Y to 8\u201d. For briefly exposed targets. discrimination and depth magnitude yield somewhat different functions of disparity. Discrimination begins to decline when depth magnitude is still increasing. This suggests that the variance of the depth signal increases faster than the magnitude of the signal. This result is consistent with the notion that stereoscopic processing involves the pooling of the activity of disparity detectors. The phenomenon of stereoscopic vision has long been an actively researched subject. Most of the studies have been concerned with small disparities for which fusion occurs. It has long been known that disparities as large as several degrees which cannot be fused, nevertheless can give rise to an impression of depth (Ogle, 1952). It has also been known that as disparity increases there is a limit beyond which depth no longer increases and eventually a second limit beyond which depth can no longer be seen. Very few studies have been devoted to determining the properties of stereopsis with large disparities. We believe that these properties are important as clues to the processes involved in stereoscopic vision. Facts about large disparity stereopsis have played an important role in suggesting the hypothesis that perceived depth may depend on a process in which the outputs from many disparity detectors are pooled with perceived depth depending on the relative activity in a small number of such pools (Richards 1971). As we have argued elsewhere both the gradual decline in perceived depth at large disparities (Foley and Richards, 1972) and the existence of partial stereoblindness or stereoanomaly (Richards, 1970, 1971) suggest this interpretation. Most experiments with large disparities have been concerned with either one of two variables: (1) the maximum disparity at which depth is seen (Ogle, 1964; Westheimer and Tanzman, 1956; Blakemore, 1970; Richards and Foley, 1971); and (2) the magnitude of the depth sensation elicited by a given disparity (Foley and Richards, 1972). There are only three observers, two of them stereoanomalous, on which both kinds of measures have been reported. One might expect that discriminability and the magnitude of perceived depth would be very closely related so that the greater the perceived depth the greater the discriminability. This is not always the case, however. For anomalous observers a large depth sensation can sometimes be elicited although discrimination among different disparities is not possible (Richards. 1971). Consequently. we have no a priori assurance that the magnitude of the depth sensation is a reliable indicator of the observer\u2019s ability to discriminate among different disparities. We cannot even be assured that when stereoscopic discrimination is greatest then the depth sensation will also be the greatest. This report compares these two measures of stereoscopic information processing.", "references": []},

Hubel", "Torsten N. Wiesel", "Michael P. Stryker"], "date": "1978", "abstract": "In the macaque monkey striate (primary visual) cortex, the grouping of cells into ocular dominance and orientation columns leads to the prediction of highly specific spatial patterns of cellular activity in response to stimulation by lines through one or both eyes. In the present paper these patterns have been examined by the 2-deoxyglucose autoradiographic method developed by Sokoloff and his group (Kennedy e t al, '76). An anesthetized monkey was given a n injection of I4C 2-deoxyglucose and then visually stimulated for 45 minutes with a large array of moving vertical stripes, with both eyes open. The 14C autoradiographs of str iate cortex showed vertical bands of label extending through the full cortical thickness. Layer I was a t most only lightly labelled, and layers IV b and VI were the most dense. Layer IV c (the site of terminations of most geniculate afferents) was labelled uniformly along its length, a s expected from the lack of orientation specificity of units recorded in tha t layer. In the other layers the pattern seen in tangential sections was complex, consisting of swirling stripes with many bifurcations and blind endings, but with occasional more regular regions where the stripes were roughly parallel. Interstripe distance was rather constant, a t 570 pm. Ocular dominance columns were examined in this same monkey, in the same region, by injecting one eye with H-proline two weeks before the deoxyglucose experiment, and preparing a second set of autoradiographs of the sections after prolonged washing to remove the 14C-deoxyglucose. As seen in tangential sections through layer IV c, these columns had the usual stripe-like form, with a period of 770 pm, but were simpler in their pattern than the orientation stripes, with fewer bifurcations and less swirling. A comparison of the two sets of columns in the same area showed many intersections, but no strict or consistent relationships: angles of intersection showed a distribution tha t was not obviously different from tha t expected for any two randomly superimposed sets of lines. Another monkey was stimulated with vertical stripes, but with only one eye open. Deoxyglucose autoradiographs of tangential sections showed regular uniform rows of label in layer IV c, with all the characteristic features of eye dominance columns. In the layers above and below IV c the rows in tangential view were broken up into regularly spaced patches of label, presumably representing aggregations of cells responsive to vertically oriented stimuli. The patches showed no consistent alignment across the ocular dominance rows, and indeed no such tendency would be expected, considering the complexity of the orientation columns. This pattern of labelling is again predicted from and confirms the previous physiological studies. Two functions of the primary visual cortex ganized in such a way tha t cells after the iniof higher mammals have now been established tial stage respond best to specifically oriented (Hubel and Wiesel, '62, '68). The information straight-line segments, rather than to spots of from the lateral geniculate body is reorlight; and the cortex is for all practical purJ. COMP. NEUR. (1978) 177: 361-380. 361 362 D. H. HUBEL. T. N. WIESEL A N D M. P. STRYKER poses the first site in the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway at which signals from the two eyes converge upon single cells. Related to and subserving these two functions are two independent sets of vertical subdivisions, the orientation columns and the ocular dominance columns (Hubel and Wiesel, '62, '63, '68, '74a). When a micro-electrode penetrates through the cortex in a direction perpendicular to the surface, recording from many cells in sequence, the optimal orientation of a stationary or moving short-line stimulus tends to be virtually constant, and the same eye remains dominant, though many cells are influenced (usually unequally) by the two eyes. In a tangential or oblique penetration the optimal orientation and the ocular dominance both vary. Orientation changes systematically in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, in small steps or perhaps continuously, at rates such tha t 180' is covered in about 600 p m or more. Reversals in the direction of rotation occur irregularly, roughly one or two to a centimeter, and occasionally the sequence may be broken by a n abrupt shift of up to go\", which we term a fracture. Ocular dominance meanwhile shifts back and forth, apparently quite independently of orientation: first one eye dominates, then the two become roughly equal, and finally the other dominates, a complete cycle occurring roughly every 800 pm. Thus while the individual subdivisions in the two systems are very different in size (25-50 p m for the orientation columns a s opposed to 400 p m for the ocular dominance) a complete set of either type, leftplus-right eye or a cycle of 180\" of orientation, occupies about the same distance on the cortex, 0.5-1 mm. One complete set of columns, of either type, has been termed a hypercolumn (Hubel and Wiesel, '74b). This is illustrated in figure 1. This description applies to all layers from I1 to VI, except for IV c , the layer in which the bulk of t he geniculo-cortical inputs terminate. In IV c the cells show no hint of orientation selectivity, but seem to have circularly symmetric center-surround receptive fields resembling the fields of geniculate cells. Moreover here the cells a re virtually all monocular, so tha t on proceeding tangenitially along IV c, crossing from one ocular dominance column to the next, the electrode passes from a region in which the cells respond only to one eye to a region monopolized by the other. There is thus a strict alternation of eyes, with abrupt transitions at the column borders. A cell above or below IV c is presumed to receive convergent input, relayed directly or over several synapses, from several of these monocular regions in IV c, and is consequently likely to be binocularly influenced, but dominated by the eye tha t corresponds to the region in I V c lying below or above along the same radial line, i.e., in the same column. The cortex is thus subdivided by two independent sets of partitions tha t a re perpendicular to the surface and the layers. These subdivisions are not visible by ordinary histological staining methods. Several lines of evidence nevertheless suggest t ha t both systems of grouping have the form of parallel vertically disposed sheets. For the eye dominance system the sheet-like geometry has been made evident by three independent anatomical methods: the Nauta/Fink-Heimer/Wiitanen stain (Hubel and Wiesel, '721, transneuronal autoradiography after eye injection (Wiesel e t al., '74; Hubel et al., '771, and a reduced silver stain (LeVay et al., '75). In tangential sections through layer IV c the ocular dominance columns appear as a set of parallel stripes. Though on the whole the stripes are remarkably regular, in places they show bifurcations and blind endings, and often form loops and whorls. The evidence tha t the orientation columns are arranged in parallel slabs stems from physiological recordings, and is deduced from reconstructions of multiple parallel penetrations (Hubel and Wiesel, '63, '74a) and from the fact tha t the orientation shifts in any single oblique or tangential penetration are small and regular. While so far there has been no anatomical method for demonstrating the orientation sheets, the recordings, and in particular the reversals and fractures, suggested tha t they might swirl and branch extensively. Figure 1 shows in schematic form a model of the monkey striate cortex (Hubel and Wiesel, '77). The diagram represents two orientation hypercolumns a n d two ocular dominance hypercolumns. I t should be kept in mind tha t the orientation columns can be far from flat, t ha t t he choice of vertical orientation to begin a n d end t h e orientation hypercolumn is arbitrary, t ha t nothing is known about the relationship between the two types of columns the decision to draw them as orthogonal is again arbitrary and tha t whether or not the orientation columns are discrete is still unsettled (Albus, '75; Hubel and Wiesel, '74a). In ORIENTATION COLUMNS IN MACAQUE MONKEY 363 this figure the orientation slabs represent regions of cortex over which optimal orientation is assumed to be constant, and the shifts in orientation from one slab to the next are represented a s 10\". I t is worth stressing, however, tha t the region of cortex activated by a line in a particular orientation would be much wider than these slabs, because for most cells the range of orientations over which responses are evoked is several times greater than 10\". Moreover, such regions of activation would not be precisely defined, since for each cell the responses vary with orientation according to a tuning curve, and since these tuning curves themselves vary in width from cell to cell. (See, for example, Schiller e t al., '76). Given these columnar groupings of cells according to response preferences, i t is possible to predict the cortical activity patterns produced by various visual stimuli. Figure 2A represents the activity pattern produced in the upper or lower layers Le., 11-111, IV b, V, or VI) by a set of vertical stimulus stripes covering a large part of the visual field and viewed by both eyes. Each shaded strip in the figure is of course maximally activated along a narrow center line: as discussed above the width of the shaded strips will depend on tuning curve widths, and their borders will not be sharp but will shade off just as tuning curves do. Figure 2B shows the pattern predicted, for the same layers, when only one eye views the vertical stripes. And finally 2C shows the pattern for one stimulus orientation (e.g., vertical) and one eye in layer IV c; here the dominance columns corresponding to the stimulated eye a re activated along their entire lengths, since cells in IV c respond equally to all line ori", "references": ["Barrels-and-columnar-cortical-organization%3A-from-Durham-Woosley/af12d985bf8d9ab741b3f83c26e53173a4780d20"]},

The presence during a short exposure of some stimulus components lying outside this zone leads to an overall reduction of stereoscopic acuity, either by dilution through summation, or by active inhibition of the best achievable depth resolution.", "references": []},

It can be applied to conscious as well as anaesthetized animals. The method is based on the use of [14C]deoxyglucose as a tracer for glucose consumption. [14C]Deoxyglucose-6-phosphate accumulates in the tissue in a mathematically definable relationship to the rate of the tissue's glucose utilization. The [14C]deoxyglucose-6-phosphate concentrations in the various tissues of the nervous system are measured by a quantitative autoradiographic technique. The autoradiographs themselves are pictorial representations of the relative rates of glucose consumption in these tissues. Application of this method to rats and monkeys in various states of altered function demonstrates a clear and close relationship between the local levels of functional activity and energy metabolism. The method appears to be useful for mapping functional neural pathways on the basis of evoked metabolic responses (Plum, Gjedde and Samson, 1976).", "references": []},

This organization has been compared to that of the primate cortical area 17 as described in previous studies and it is discussed in relationship to the distribution of afferents from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). The visual cortex of the cat and monkey show strong similarities in the laminar positions of neurons projecting extrinsically and also in the restriction of spiny stellate neurons to a central lamina (lamina 4) receiving input from the dLGN. However, lamina 4B in the monkey, which contains spiny stellate neurons but does not receive direct input from the dLGN, has no direct counterpart in cat area 17. Axon projections of spiny stellate neurons in the other divisions of lamina 4 differ in cat and monkey: the small, closely packed neurons in the lowermost division of lamina 4 (4B in the cat, 4Cbeta in the monkey) project chiefly within lamina 4 in the cat whereas in the monkey they have a strong projection to lamina 3. In the cat, spiny stellate neurons of lamina 4A project upon lamina 3 whereas in the monkey those in the apparently equivalent zone, 4Calpha, project upon lamina 4B. Most non-spiny stellate neurons examined have precisely organized interlaminar axonal projections which differ from the axon trajectories of neighboring spiny neurons.", "references": []},

The responses of single units in the cat's primary visual cortex to moving bars have been examined quantitatively as a function of bar length.2. For about half the cells studied, very long bars evoked weaker responses than short bars, implying that there were inhibitory regions flanking the receptive field centre. In another quarter of the cell sample, there was evidence of flanking regions which were facilitatory in effect.3. The strength of the flanking regions was found to vary from cell to cell and there was no sudden transition between cells which were ;hyper-complex' and those which were not.4. Within the central region of the receptive field, the responses of most (but not all) cells increased with bar length. About half the cells responded to very short bars or spots of light, but about one in six would not respond at all to short bars.5. Correlations were sought between the properties of cells as simple or complex, their responsiveness to moving spots of light, the size of their receptive field centre and the polarity, strength and size of their receptive field flanks. Simple and complex cells with small receptive fields were more likely to respond well to spots, and to have strong inhibitory flanks.6. Correlations were also sought between the above properties and several other parameters of cell behaviour. Cells with strong inhibitory flanks were found to be more broadly tuned for orientation. Individual cells were also more broadly tuned for the orientation of short bars than of long bars.7.

Leventhal", "Helmut V. B. Hirsch"], "date": "1978", "abstract": "1. Receptive-field properties of neurons in the different layers of the visual cortex of normal adult cats were analyzed quantitatively. Neurons were classified into one of two groups: 1) S-cells, which have discrete on- and/or off-regions in their receptive fields and possess inhibitory side bands; 2) C-cells, which do not have discrete on- and off-regions in their receptive fields but display an on-off response to flashing stimuli. Neurons of this type rarely display side-band inhibition. 2. As a group, S-cells display lower relative degrees of binocularity and are more selective for stimulus orientation than C-cells. In addition, within a given lamina the S-cells have smaller receptive fields, lower cutoff velocities, lower peak responses to visual stimulation, and lower spontaneous activity than do the C-cells. 3. S-cells in all layers of the cortex display similar orientation sensitivities, mean spontaneous discharge rates, peak response to visual stimulation, and degrees of binocularity. 4. Many of the receptive-field properties of cortical cells vary with laminar location. Receptive-field sizes and cutoff velocities of S-cells and of C-cells are greater in layers V and VI than in layers II-IV. For S-cells, preferred velocities are also greater in layers V and VI than in layers II-IV. Furthermore, C-cells in layers V and VI display high mean spontaneous discharge rates, weak orientation preferences, high relative degrees of binocularity, and higher peak responses to visual stimulation when compared to C-cells in layers II and III. 5. The receptive-field properties of cells in layers V-VI of the striate cortex suggest that most neurons that have their somata in these laminae receive afferents from LGNd Y-cells. Hence, our results suggest that afferents from LGNd Y-cells may play a major part in the cortical control of subcortical visual functions.", "references": []},

Autoradiographs were prepared from either frozen or paraffin coronal sections through the rat brain. The dorsal nucleus of the lateral geniculate projected via the optic radiation to area 17 of the cerebral cortex. There was also a slight extension of label into the zones of transition between areas 17, 18 and 18a. The distribution of silver grains in the various layers of the cerebral cortex was analyzed quantitatively and showed a major peak of labeling in layer IV with minor peaks in outer layer I and the upper half and lowest part of layer VI. The significance of these peaks is discussed in respect to the distribution of geniculocortical terminals in other mammalian species. The ventral nucleus of the lateral geniculate body had 5 major projections to brain stem structures both ipsilateral and contralateral to the injected nucleus. There were two dorsomedial projections: (1) a projection to the superior colliculus which terminated mainly in the medial third of the stratum opticum, and (2) a large projection via the superior thalamic radiation which terminated in the ipsilateral pretectal area; a continuation of this projection passed through the posterior commissure to attain the contralateral pretectal area. The three ventromedial projections involved: (1) a geniculopontine tract which coursed through the basis pedunculi and the lateral lemniscus to terminate in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral parts of the pons after giving terminals to the lateral terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract, (2) a projection via Meynert's commissure to the suprachiasmatic nuclei of both sides of the brain stem as well as to the contralateral ventral lateral geniculate nucleus and lateral terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract, and (3) a medial projection to the ipsilateral zona incerta. The results obtained in these experiments are contrasted with other data on the rat's central visual connections to illustrate the importance of these connections in many subcortical visual functions.", "references": []},

Gilbert"], "date": "1977", "abstract": "1. Cells in area 17 of the cat visual cortex were studied with a view towards correlating receptive field properties with layering. A number of receptive field parameters were measured for all units, and nearly every unit was marked with a microlesion to determine accurately the layer in which it was found.2. Cells were defined as simple or complex by mapping with stationary stimuli, using the criteria of Hubel & Wiesel (1962). Complex cells fell into two groups: those that showed summation for increased slit length (standard complex) and those that did not (special complex).3. The simple cells were located in the deep part of layer 3, in layer 4, and in layer 6. This corresponds to the distribution of afferents from the dorsal layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. In these cortical layers the simple cells differed primarily with respect to their receptive field size, cells in layer 4 having the smallest, layer 3 intermediate, and layer 6 the largest fields. Layer 4 was the only layer in which simple cells showed end-inhibition (a reduction in response to slits extending beyond the excitatory portion of the receptive field).4. The standard complex cells were found in all layers, but were quite scarce in layer 4. As with the simple cells, field size varied with layer: in layer 2+3 they had small to intermediate field sizes, in layer 5 intermediate, and in layer 6 very large. Layer 6 cells showed summation for slits of increased length up to very large values, and responded best when the slits were centred in the receptive field. The only standard complex cells that showed end-inhibition were those in layer 2+3, and these were similar to the layer 4 simple cells in terms of proportion of end-inhibited units and degree of end-inhibition.5. The special complex cells, originally described by Palmer & Rosenquist (1974), were found in two tiers: the upper one at the layer 3/layer 4 border and the lower one in layer 5. They were different from the standard complex cells in having a high spontaneous activity, high velocity preference, and large fields which were similar in size (at a given eccentricity) from one cell to the next. Many showed reduced response to slits of increasing length, even for slits that did not extend beyond the borders of the responsive region.6. Cells in layer 6 (the origin of the corticogeniculate projection) were antidromically activated from the lateral geniculate nucleus. The antidromically activated units included both simple and complex cells, and they had the long receptive fields characteristic of the overall population of cells in layer 6.7. The results showed that there are different types of simple and complex cells, and that cells in different layers have different properties. Taken together with their differences in site of projection, this demonstrates that the anatomical lamination pattern is reflected in functional differences between cells in different layers.", "references": []},

The preferred orientation and the range of orientation sensitivity of cells in close proximity to one another have been determined in order to investigate the spatial arrangement of the orientation domain in area 17. 1. A slight overrepresentation of vertical and horizontal orientations is seen in cells with complex receptive fields, whereas in cells with simple fields all orientations are represented to an equal degree. The orientation selectivity, defined as the halfwidth of tuning curves constructed from the cells response to a moving stimulus, is less than 60 degrees in more than 80% of all cells investigated, and is on the average 20-30 degrees smaller in cells with simple than in cells with complex receptive fields. 2. In 80% of all cases considered the difference in the preferred orientation between two cells less than 200 mum horizontally distant in area 17 is less than 30 degrees, which is of the order of an individual cells orientation selectivity. Each cell, therefore, will respond to some extent to that orientation which is preferred by the cells in the immediate surroundings. 3. Sequential changes in the preferred orientation between cells successively recorded are observed as the postlateral gyrus is explored from anterior to posterior and from medial to lateral. On these general trends a random variation in the preferred orientation between neighbouring cells of the order of 5-10 degrees is superimposed. One orientation sequence (180 degrees) occupies 700-1200 mum, so that on the average a change in the preferred orientation of the order of 10 degrees is complete after 50 mum distance in the cortex measured parallel to the pial surface. Assuming that 18 different orientations (+/- 5 degrees) functionally represent one complete orientation sequence it is found that 'all' orientations are functionally represented by the cells contained in a cortical cylinder of 300-700 mum in diameter. 4. Cells having the same preferred orientation are grouped together in cortical regions which appear in crossection as a band or a spot. These regions have been termed iso-orientation bands or spots. The diameter of the spots and the small diameter of the bands do not exceed 100 mum. Taking an average orientation selectivity of 40 degrees for cells vertically aligned in area 17 it is calculated that cells situated 100 mum to either side of an iso-orientation band or around an iso-orientation spot still respond with 50% of the discharge to their own optimal orientation ...", "references": []},

All languages exhibi t certain peculiar character is t ics such as let ter combinat ions, f requency of occurrence of let ters and init ial and terminal le t ters of words.

This fact leads one to believe t h a t using this and other techniques could dramat ical ly improve the abil i ty of character recognit ion methods to filter out noisy input and improve accuracy. There has been considerable work done recently in the field of using computers to recognize printed or typed characters [1, 2, 3]. To the authors' knowledge there has been little, if any, use of the fact that most written languages have certain letter patterns which occur often and that certain other patterns are unlikely. In fact, one observer comments that \"A certain recognition technique perhaps should be coupled with other procedures to obtain truly effective, easily in~plemented and reliable character recognition. The loss introduced by a mixed recognition system appears to be solely one of elegance\" [4]. Cryptographers, of course, have used their knowledge of letter patterns to considerable advantage in decoding secret messages. It is well known, for instance, that in English text the most frequently used letter is E and that the letter T is most often the first letter of a word. Many other facts are also known about combination of letters, frequency of letter occurrence, etc. Could not this knowledge be used as information to a cornputer to allow it to more accurately read a text consisting of alphabetic characters only? Some preliminary tests indicate that such a method would improve accuracy of character recognition systems. Most character recognition methods are affected by \"noise\" from poor printing, dirt on the paper and similar conditions. The computer is then faced with the problem of deciding if the input is due to actual data or extraneous information. The letter H might be easily distorted into an A or an R by noise in the input. In instances like these the human brain easily supplies the proper letter by using context. For instance, the word C-W must either be COW or CAW since none of the other letters in the alphabet result in proper English words. While it would no doubt be difficult to \"teach\" a computer enough facts to perform this type of reasoning, there is good data available on the occurrence of digraphs or combination of two letters in the conunon languages. There are available at least two tabulations which show the occurrence in English of the various letters of the alphabet taken two at a time [5, 6]. 465 Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery, Vol. 11, No. 4 (October, 1964), pp. 465-470 4 6 6 A.W.

The response properties of 354 single neurons in the medial (M), dorsomedial (DM), dorsolateral (DL), and middle temporal (MT) visual areas were studied quantitatively with bar, spot, and random-dot stimuli in chronically implanted owl monkeys with fixed gaze. 2. A directionality index was computed to compare the responses to stimuli in the optimal direction with the responses to the opposing direction of movement. The greater the difference between opposing directions, the higher the index. MT cells had much higher direction indices to moving bars than cells in DL, DM, and M. 3. A tuning index was computed for each cell to compare the responses to bars moving in the optimal direction, or flashed in the optimal orientation, with the responses in other directions or orientations within +/- 90 degrees. Cells in all four areas were more sharply tuned to the orientation of stationary flashed bars than to moving bars, although a few cells (9/92( were unresponsive in the absence of movement. DM cells tended to be more sharply tuned to moving bars than cells in the other areas. 4. Directionality in DM, DL, and MT was relatively unaffected by the use of single-spot stimuli instead of bars; tuning in all four areas was broader to spots than bars. 5. Moving arrays of randomly spaced spots were more strongly excitatory than bar stimuli for many neurons in MT (16/31 cells). These random-dot stimuli were also effective in M, but evoked no response or weak responses from most cells in DM and DL. 6. The best velocities of movement were usually in the range of 10-100 degrees/s, although a few cells (22/227), primarily in MT (14/69 cells), preferred higher velocities. 7. Receptive fields of neurons in all four areas were much larger than striate receptive fields.

On an axis perpendicular to this plane of rerepresentation, best-frequency (represented cochlear place) changes as a simple function of cortical location. 3) Any given frequency band (or sector of the cochlear partition) is represented across a belt of cortex of nearly constant width that runs on a nearly straight axis across AI. 4) There is a disproportionately large cortical surface representation of the highest-frequency octaves (basal cochlea) within AI. 5) The primary and secondary field locations were somewhat variable, when referenced to cortical surface landmarks. 6) Data from long penetrations passing down the rostral bank of the posterior ectosylvian sulcus were consistent with the existence of a vertical unit of organization in AI, akin to cortical columns described in primary visual and somatosensory cortex. 7) Responses to tonal stimuli were encountered in fields dorsocaudal, caudal, ventral, and rostral to AI.

No two of the experiments referenced above employ exactly the same operations of physical measurement , and an essential communality between them is not easy to specify in objective terms. In the study reported here, ratings of the complexity of nonrepresenta-tional shapes were obtained from a large number of Ss and related to measurable physical characteristics of the shapes.

In a k X k matrix, n random points were plotted, i.e., all coordinates of the points were random numbers between 1 and k. The points were then connected randomly into a polygon of n sides. This connecting process involved two steps. First, peripheral points were connected into a convex polygon which enclosed all the points not included in its contour (as if a pin were stuck into each point and a rubber band snapped around the whole cluster). Second, the unconnected points were given a random order and each in turn was \"taken into\" a randomly chosen segment of the surrounding polygon (as if by hooking that segment of the rubber band over the interior pin). Since lines connecting the points were not permitted to cross, the number of alternative segments into which a given point might be taken could either increase or decrease as the process continued; hence the assignment of a random sequence to the unconnected points. Connections which placed certain points outside the polygon were permitted, though in consequence the ways in which such points could themselves be connected were restricted.

All the cells (158) that we studied in the lateral geniculate nuclei of Macaca nemestrina and Macaca irus could be distinguished as either X-like or Y-like on the basis of their responses to tests developed to classify cat retinal and lateral geniculate nucleus cells. These tests include responses to stationary spots, fast moving wands and moving gratings. 2. Response latencies to electrical stimulation of the optic chiasm were determined for 130 cells; no X-like cell showed a latency shorter than 1-7 ms, no Y-like cell showed a latency longer than 1-6 ms. Primate lateral geniculate nucleus cells with X-like properties thus receive their excitatory input from retinal cells with slowly conducting axons and these most probably include the tonic ganglion cells described by Gouras (1968, 1969); Y-like lateral geniculate nucleus cells are driven by retinal cells with faster conducting axons, most probably including the phasic ganglion cells described by Gouras. 3. Wiesel & Hubel (1966) classified monkey lateral geniculate nucleus cells into four main types based on their receptive-field properties, as revealed by spectrally and spatially distinct stimuli.

Type III consists of a subtype that show X-like properties, here termed Type IIIx, and a subtype that show Y-like properties, here termed Type IIIy. 4. The first cells encountered as the micro-electrode reached the lateral geniculate nucleus were always X-like. In some penetrations only X-like cells were encountered as the electrode moved downward through the lateral geniculate nucleus. In the remaining penetrations, after recording X-like cells through most of the lateral geniculate nucleus, Y-like cells were then encountered. No X-like cells were found below Y-like cells. thus these two classes of cells are anatomically segregated within the primate lateral geniculate nucleus. Electrode marking showed the borger between X-like and Y-like cells to correspond to the border between the paro- and magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Thus X-like cells (i.e. Types I, II and IIIx) occur in the parvocellular layers, Y-like cells (i.e. Types IIIy and IV)in the magnocellular layers.", "references": []},

The maxima of their frequency characteristics lie in the range of 0.3-5.0 c/deg and do not change under various modifications of experimental conditions. The response of the complex receptive fields to gratings of different spatial frequencies and single slits of different width can be predicted from the spatial frequency characteristics of these stimuli. The complex receptive fields may have, in addition to a main maximum and a low frequency band-pass region, an additional maximum. The complex receptive fields have several centers of discharge. It is suggested that these complex receptive fields are neurophysiological correlates of spatial-frequency channels revealed in many psychophysical experiments. Following the work of Campbell and Robson (1964, 1968) there appeared a number of investigations (Blakemore and Campbell, 1969: Sachs, Nachmias and Robson, 1971; Graham and Nachmias, 1971; Sullivan, Georgeson and Oatley, 1972; Kulikowski. Abadi and King-Smith, 1973). showing the existence of independent spatial frequency channels in the visual system. These channels were assumed to perform the Fourier analysis of the image. Studies of the complex receptive fields in the visual cortex of the cat have suggested that these fields perform a generalised Fourier analysis over limited regions of the visual field (piecewise) (Glezer, 1970; Glezer, Ivanov and Tsherbach, 1972, 1973).

The present study was undertaken to determine whether STS also receives a direct projection from areas of striate cortex representing peripheral vision, with the intent of defining the entire striate projection zone in STS as well as providing information regarding a possible topographic organization within this secondary visual area. A series of five rhesus monkeys was prepared with unilateral lesions of lateral, posterior, or medial striate cortex, such that, collectively, the lesions in the series included all of striate cortex with little or no invasion of prestriate cortex. The monkeys were sacrificed seven days after surgery and their brains were processed by the Fink-Heimer procedure. An analysis of the distribution of terminal degeneration within STS indicated: (1) All areas of striate cortex project to a restricted region along the caudal portion of STS. The ventral limit of this region can be demarcated by an imaginary line connecting the ventral tips of the lunate and intraparietal sulci; from this limit the region extends dorsocaudally for approximately 12 mm to the point at which STS frequently bifurcates, sending one spur forward into the inferior parietal lobule. (2) Within this portion of STS there is an orderly mapping of the visual field; progression from central vision to the far periphery is represented by a progression down the posterior bank of STS and continuing along the entire floor, or insula-like portion, of the sulcus. (3) Projections from striate cortex to STS terminate predominantly in layer IV and the deep part of layer III. (4) There is a distinctive pattern of myelination contained within the striate projection zone of STS. These anatomical findings concerning the striate projection zone of STS in the rhesus monkey are remarkably similar to those that have been described for the middle temporal visual area (MT) in New World monkeys, and thus support earlier proposals that the two areas are homologous.", "references": []},

In both the owl monkey and the bushbaby, a discrete band of degenerating axonal terminals corresponds precisely to the vertical meridian representation at the V1-V2 border, and a less precise increase in the density of degenerating axonal terminals corresponds to the vertical meridian representation of extrastriate area MT.

It is clear that binocular convergence at the cellular level does not occur to any important extent in layer IVC, which is divided vertically into two sets of more or less parallel alternating stripes of remarkably constant width, one receiving input from the left eye and the other from the right eye. A similar system can be discerned in the cat 1\u00b0, but the segregation of inputs is less complete. Though layer IVC in the macaque is divided into several sublaminae1337, these seem to be unrelated to binocular convergence: the 4 dorsal geniculate layers, two for each eye, project to the upper subdivision of IVC, the ventral 2 layers, one for each eye, to the lower subdivision; the dorsal layers in addition project to a thin strip ('upper tier') in IVA just above the line of Gennari. A recent study by Harting et ak 8 has pointed to a very different pattern of binocular convergence in the tree shrew. These authors made small lesions in the dorsal lateral geniculate body and looked for terminal degeneration in the cortex with the Fink-Heimer modification of the Nauta method. They found no hint of any columnar subdivisions, but instead an apparent horizontal segregation of input from the two eyes into 6 laminar subdivisions of the cell-dense internal granular layer. They suggest that each of the 6 geniculate layers projects to one of these subdivisions; no. 1, the most medial geniculate layer, projecting to the most superficial subdivision and no. 6 to the deepest.

As such, it is assumed to be of central significance in the coordination of visually-guided behavior (Huber and Crosby, '33; Ariens Kappers, Huber and Crosby, '36) . Ascending the evolutionary scale, the superior colliculus of mammals receives fewer and fewer fibers from the optic tract, as an increasing proportion of these fibers terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus (Polyak, '57). In spite of this apparent comparative decline, the size and complexity of the mammalian superior colliculus (Huber and Crosby, '43) suggests that it is by no means a vestigial structure of little functional importance.

Methods used were autoradiography of transneuronally transported 3H-proline injected into one eye, and physiological recordings. In the adult cat, patches of label in layer IV corresponding to ocular dominance columns were seen both ipsilateral and contralateral to the injected eye. Between the patches, however, grain density was substantially above background, especially on the contralateral side. Similarly, in the contralateral lateral geniculate nucleus CLGN) there was substantial labelling of neuronal cell bodies in lamina AI, which receives no innervation from the injected eye. Such spillover of radioactivity into the inappropriate laminae of the LGN was measured in autoradiographs of semi thin sections, and its effect on the cortical labelling pattern calculated. Spillover appeared to account quantitatively for the labelling seen between patches in the cortex. It was concluded that the geniculocortical afferents for the ipsilateral and contralateral eyes are equally and almost completely segregated from each other at the centers of columns, although there is extensive overlap at the borders. This pattern is consistent with the physiological pattern of ocular dominance in layer IV. In kittens studied at one to two weeks of age, radioactive label formed a continuous band in layer IV on both sides of the brain. On the ipsilateral side, this appearance could not be accounted for by spillover in the LGN, but reflected a continuous, non-columnar distribution of afferents. Physiological recordings at this age showed most cells in layer IV to be nearly equally responsive to stimulation of either eye, in contrast to the adult pattern. Periodic variations in grain density were first noted at three weeks, and a pattern similar to that of the adult was reached by about six weeks of age. On the contralateral side the uniform labelling pattern seen in the 1to 2-week-old kittens was uninterpretable, owing to the very great spillover of radioactivity in the contralateral LGN, but the physiology suggested that the contralateral afferents, too, were uniformly distributed", "references": ["Ocular-dominance-in-layer-IV-of-the-cat's-visual-of-Shatz-Stryker/04656ba65e83fa6abd963b3e5577141125d5c2d9", "Mapping-the-developing-retinotectal-projection-in-a-Jacobson/b70c3dbd8fe844ca8bdf5e7a5ba08aa527613a70", "Neurons-in-layer-I-of-the-developing-occipital-of-Bradford-Parnavelas/214e26578e7d884377107de41eb88c850226929b", "Plasticity-of-ocular-dominance-columns-in-monkey-Hubel-Wiesel/ea2fa92fbef1ca570ae093f751ecb2e0bcfb67b8", "Laminar-patterns-of-geniculocortical-projection-in-Levay-Gilbert/fb6dbb3b713f806c8fba4d382cab6621af06d4e5", "Morphological-aspects-of-the-elimination-of-of-in-Korneliussen-Jansen/6fcaac8d6efdd3563b8c979d22cbe98b66780e8d", "Multiple-axon-branches-innervating-single-endplates-Riley/138a0088c6048aeaa63638b7a7c1f5c38769d799", "Polyneuronal-innervation-of-skeletal-muscle-in-rats-Brown-Jansen/795eba4385368c66a88310fa432ba5e6bcda225e"]},

Fields were identified by cytoarchitectonic features and by thalamic connectivity in the same brains. Area 3a was identified by first recording a short latency group I afferent evoked potential. Attempts were made to analyze the data in terms of: (1) routes whereby somatic sensory input might influence the performance of motor cortex neurons; (2) possible multiple representations of the body surface in the component fields of the first somatic sensory area (SI). Apart from vertical interlaminar connections, two types of intracortical connectivity are recognized. The first, regarded as \"non-specific,\" consists of axons spreading out in layers I, III and V-VI from all sides of an injection of isotope; these cross architectonic borders indiscrimininately. They are not unique to the regions studied. The second is formed by axons entering the white matter and re-entering other fields. In these, they terminate in layers I-IV in one or more mediolaterally oriented strips of fairly constant width (0.5--1 mm) and separated by gaps of comparable size. Though there is a broadly systematic topography in these projections, the strips are probably best regarded as representing some feature other than receptive field position. Separate representations are nevertheless implied in area 3b, in areas 1 and 2 (together), in areas 3a and 4 (together) and in area 5; with, in each case, the representations of the digits pointed at the central sulcus. Area 3b is not connected with areas 3a or 4, but projects to a combined areas 1 and 2. Area 1 is reciprocally connected with area 3a and area 2 reciprocally with area 4. The connectivity of area 3a, as conventionally identified, is such that it is probably best regarded not as an entity, but as a part of area 4. Areas identified by others as area 3a should probably be regraded as parts of area 3b. Parts of area 5 that should be more properly considered as area 2, and other parts that receive thalamic input not from the ventrobasal complex but from the lateral nuclear complex and anterior pulvinar, are also interconnected with area 4. More posterior parts of area 5 are connected with laterally placed parts of area 6. A more medial part of area 6, the supplementary motor area, occupies a pivotal position in the sensory-motor cortex, for it receives fibers from areas 3a, 4, 1, 2 and 5 (all parts), and projects back to areas 3a, 4 and 5.", "references": []},

The precise role of the prefrontal cortex in these is not yet clear. In contrast to the abundant documen ta-tion of the effects of frontal ablations, the literature 011 the neuroelectrical correlates of delayed-response behavior is brief and recent. In 1969, Stamm and Rosen (43) showed steady potential shifts in the cortex of monkeys during a delayed-response test. Their most significant finding was a slow negative potential on the surface of the l&frontal cortex at the beginning of the delay period, suggesting that at that time there is in that region an increase of neu-ronal excitability.

Some units are more active immediately before lever-pressing than during the delays; others show the opposite pattern. A previous investigation showed that bilateral or unilateral cooling of the pre-frontal cortical convexity produces marked and reversible deficits of performance in animals trained at the direct-method version of the delayed-response test (16). It is because of these results that the same behav-ioral test was adopted for the present study: a microelectrode exploration of the pre-frontal cortex of the monkey performing the delayed-response task.

The findings are consistent, however, with the assumption of a continuous distribution of orientation sensitivity across the cortical surface with considerable superimposed scatter.", "references": ["A-quantitative-study-of-the-projection-area-of-the-Albus/144f84d6f5638fa03442a6ae133eb0053b41d2cc", "Invariance-of-orientational-and-directional-tuning-Hammond-Andrews/dc467515df77e85c18d2c541a94ebe586f653e44", "Notes-on-the-hypothesis-of-columnar-organization-in-Towe/5032385591c91c82298e9c4e271955d4e6aa2562", "The-pattern-of-ocular-dominance-columns-in-macaque-Levay-Hubel/2f9d1f37d46969d496fb3acc850f920d0d2bdaef", "Variability-of-the-relative-preference-for-stimulus-Donaldson-Nash/d920592707145b58e941ceba2cd3eb0756faaf9a", "An-analysis-of-orientation-selectivity-in-the-cat's-Rose-Blakemore/57fe42ad5e56f1d4af09b7f4c4224a454a78717c", "Autoradiographic-demonstration-of-ocular-dominance-Wiesel-Hubel/0c8ef5350359847cf54d2b909014951a3c619b61", "Orientation%2C-axis-and-direction-as-stimulus-for-Henry-Bishop/ae25efd8a044c21fbc2bfee6afe30ac410d65307", "Sequence-regularity-and-geometry-of-orientation-in-Hubel-Wiesel/1c387b70f37fd902735e6c2b76d9715a251d1b5e"]},

Graybiel"], "date": "1975", "abstract": "The distribution of retinotectal afferents has been studied by autoradiography in 4 adult cats. The findings suggest that crossed and uncrossed retinal fibers terminate in a striking cluster-and-sheet pattern that varies systematically with respect to the retinotopic map of the colliculus. Following unilateral eye injection, labelling was most pronounced in the contralateral colliculus but a suprising volume of label appeared on the ipsilateral side in all cases in the form of dense clumps of silver grains separated by sparsely labelled zones. The contralateral projection appeared densest in the most superficial of the 3 laminae of the stratum griseum superficiale; appreciable labelling was present also in the middle lamina at all survival times used (23-72 h). Near the area centralis representation labelling in both contralateral tiers weakened markedly and local gaps appeared densest in the more dorsal band. Elsewhere, labelling in this dorsal band was generally dense, though sharply interrupted at the optic disc representation and in a curious, elongated lateral zone at mid-collicular levels. In the caudal half of the binocular zone rarefications or 'holes', about 200 mum wide, appeared in the more ventral tier between more densely labelled zones of roughly similar width. On the ipsilateral side, labelling was sparse or absent at the rostral and caudal collicular poles, and was also weak in the region of the area centralis representation save for occasional very superficial grain-clusters. Farther caudally, however, prominent approx. 200 mum wide 'puffs' of label marked the middle lamina of the superficial gray layer. The puffs were most regular in shape in the caudal half of the ipsilateral zone and these were spaced at roughly 200 mum intervals. Puffs lateral to the horizontal meridian representation tended to lie more dorsal than those medial to this line and some of the most lateral puffs at mid-collicular levels invaded the upper lamina of the superficial gray layer. The optic disc representation was marked by a column of label extending through the upper and middle laminae. Similar experiments in cat fetuses suggest that these staggered--and possible even complementary--patterns of crossed and uncrossed retinotectal projection are innate: ipsilateral 'puffs' of labelling and contralateral 'holes' appear in the superior colliculus at least one week before term, as does the ipsilateral filling-in and contralateral gap at the optic disc representation. These observations suggest that in the cat, a vertical as well as horizontal organization may characterize the superficial layers of the superior colliculus. The additional finding of a similar, interrupted puff-like pattern of labelling in the stratum griseum medium following injections in the region of the substantia nigra makes it likely that a somewhat comparable cluster-and-sheet organization may exist also in the deep collicular layers.", "references": []},

The relation between the physiological pattern of ocular dominance and the anatomical distribution of geniculocortical afferents serving each eye was studied in layer IV of the primary visual cortex of normal and monocularly deprived cats. 2. One eye was injected with radioactive label. After allowing sufficient time for transeuronal transport, micro-electrode recordings were made, and the geniculocoritcal afferents serving the injected eye were located autoradiographically. 3. In layer IV of normal cats, cell were clustered according to eye preference, and fewer cells were binocularly driven than in other layers. Points of transition between groups of cells dominated by one eye and those dominated by the other were marked with electrolytic lesions. A good correspondence was found between the location of cells dominated by the injected eye and the patches of radioactively labelled geniculocortical afferents. 4. Following prolonged early monocular deprivation, the patches of geniculocortical afferents in layer IV serving the deprived eye were smaller, and those serving the non-deprived eye larger, than normal. Again there was a coincidence between the patches of radioactively labelled afferents and the location of cells dominated by the injected eye. 5. The deprived eye was found to dominate a substantial fraction (22%) of cortical cells in the fourth layer. In other cortical layers, only 7% of the cells were dominated by the deprived eye. 6.

Horizontal, vertical and classical non-pyramidal cells without axons were recognized. Horizontal cells included foetal horizontal cells (Retzius-Cajal cells) and persisting horizontal cells. The former were fully differentiated and numerous at birth and were bipolar, with dendrite and axon extending from opposite poles, and fine ascending (vertical) branches. Some such cells possessed two axons. Almost all degenerated and disappeared over the first two to three postnatal weeks. An analogy with Rohon-Beard cells is drawn and it is suggested that these cells receive an early input which is subsequently withdrawn and/or concentrated on cells in deeper layers. There is no evidence of transformation of foetal to persisting horizontal cells, which are not numerous and most commonly give rise to two dendrites from opposite perikaryal poles. Vertical cells, with spinous dendrites and descending axons, differentiate and reach adult numbers by the end of the first postnatal week. Classical non-pyramidal cells include spinous and spine-free varieties, resemble those in deeper layers, and are mature by the end of the third postnatal week.

Cleland", "William R. Levick"], "date": "1974", "abstract": "1. In a reference sample of 960 cat retinal ganglion cells, seventy-three had receptive fields departing from the concentric centre-surround pattern.2. Five classes were distinguished among the subset: local edge detectors, direction-selective cells, colour-coded cells, uniformity detectors, edge inhibitory off-centre cells.3. Local edge detectors (forty-five) possessed a radially symmetrical pattern of responses to both centrifugal and centripetal movements of both black and white small targets, an on-off receptive field with a silent inhibitory surround and a low or zero maintained discharge. Their operation could be interpreted as the detection of a contrasting border confined to a small region of the visual field.4. With direction-selective units (eleven) it was possible to find an axis through the receptive field along which sharply different responses could be obtained for opposite directions of movement of small black or white targets.5. Colour units (six) were mostly of the single opponent type having excitatory input from blue-sensitive cones and inhibitory input from long wave-length cones. Both inputs coexisted at the centre of the field and either could be spatially more extensive than the other. One example changed over to rod input under scotopic conditions, another did not.6. Uniformity detectors (five) had a brisk maintained discharge which was reduced or abolished temporarily by all forms of visual stimulation.7. Edge inhibitory off-centre units (three) behaved like uniformity detectors for small targets and fine gratings but like off-centre on-surround units for large targets. Their receptive fields consisted of three concentric regions: a small sized, central edge inhibitory region; a larger zone of off-responsiveness; and an outlying annulus of on-responsiveness.8. It is argued that the above physiological types belong to the morphologically heterogeneous class of cells called gamma cells. The argument is based on similarity in the sizes of receptive fields and dendritic trees and on evidence that the axons are thinner than those of the brisk-sustained and brisk-transient ganglion cells.9. The physiological classification of cat retinal ganglion cells developed in this paper and the preceding one is summarized in a Table.10. It now appears that cat and rabbit possess a qualitatively similar complement of receptive field types among their ganglion cells; the differences reside in the quantitative expression of the various classes.", "references": []},

Most LSSA units were poorly responsive to stationary visual stimuli, but they responded vigorously to moving visual stimuli. Their receptive fields appeared to be constituted of a large activating region (discharge area) often surrounded by inhibitory flanks. Relating unit behavior to changes of stimulus length, the LSSA neurons could be subdivided into 5 categories. The first category (22 out of 95 units tested, 23.16%) consisted of units showing summation inside the discharge area. Expanding the stimulus outside the discharge area did not affect the response. The second category (7.37%) was formed by units which showed summation inside the discharge area and inhibition when the stimulus was extended outside the discharge area. The third category (21.05%) consisted of units largely insensitive to the stimulus length inside the discharge area, but surrounded by inhibitory flanks. The fourth category (41.05%) consisted of units which showed inhibition of the response when the stimulus, well inside the discharge area, became longer than a certain optimal lenght. They were surrounded by inhibitory flanks. The fifth category (7.37%) was formed by units insensitive to variations of the stimulus length inside as well as outside the discharge area. Almost all units, independent of their category, were directionally specific, that is their response could be decreased 50% or more by varying the direction of movement away from that which gave the maximal response (preferred direction). Typically the response was halved when the stimulus was moved +/- 50 degrees from the preferred direction. Among the directionally specific units, 71% showed the minimal response 180 degrees away from the preferred direction (direction specificity curve type 1), 20% had the minimal response 90 degrees from the preferred direction (direction specificity curve type 2); the remaining could not be classified in this respect. Of LSSA units, 87% (all those of type 1 and many of those of type 2) were directionally selective, that is their response to movement in the preferred direction was at least double that in the opposite direction. The LSSA units usually preferred stimuli moving at rather high speeds. The optimal speed for 71% of units was 20 degrees/sec or greater. Almost all units responded over a wide range of speeds, many of them from 5-10 degrees/sec to over 100 degrees/sec.

It is located ventral to and continuous with visual area 11, at about the caudal half of M. Rose's temporal cortices 1 and 2 (T1 and T2). Only about two-thirds of 96 units studied responded to some sort of moving light stimulation. These motion-sensitive cells were divided into four groups. Cells in the first group (22) responded best to a large light spot or shadow sweeping quickly across the field. Cells in the second group (29) responded to slow moving, jerking spot. Nine cells responded to a narrow, dark bar thrusting into a lighted field. Four cells are \"direction-selective,\" responding to light stimulus moving in one direction and showing either no response or decreased background discharges in the opposite direction. In addition, three cells required unusual stimulus features. Of the 38 cells tested, nine of them were found to be binocularly driven.

In all cases, there was a regular pattern of labelling. In the retina, the proline-labelled cells were always central to the thymidine-labelled cell nuclei, and in the long survivors there was a sharp transition between the cells occupying the central labelled retina and the surrounding unlabelled cells at the retinal periphery.

Useful vision seems to be lost in the deprived eye, and neurophysiological studies reveal a loss of binocular input to neurones in the visual cortex. Most neurones fail to respond to stimuli presented to the deprived eye; whereas almost all respond to stimulation of the normal eye. In normal neonatal kittens without visual experience, most cortical neurones respond to stimulation of either eye. Moreover, this binocular neuronal input persists when subsequent visual experience is prevented by binocular lid suture. Thus, asymmetrical visual experience seems necessary to produce a loss of binocular input. This loss of functional input from the deprived eye could result from a loss of the normal excitatory synaptic connections or from inhibitory suppression of afferent input. We postulate that asymmetrical visual experience causes synaptic inhibition of input from the deprived eye and that reduction of such inhibition might restore binocularity.", "references": []},

The preferred orientation and the range of orientation sensitivity of cells in close proximity to one another have been determined in order to investigate the spatial arrangement of the orientation domain in area 17. 1. A slight overrepresentation of vertical and horizontal orientations is seen in cells with complex receptive fields, whereas in cells with simple fields all orientations are represented to an equal degree. The orientation selectivity, defined as the halfwidth of tuning curves constructed from the cells response to a moving stimulus, is less than 60 degrees in more than 80% of all cells investigated, and is on the average 20\u201330 degrees smaller in cells with simple than in cells with complex receptive fields. 2. In 80% of all cases considered the difference in the preferred orientation between two cells less than 200 \u03bcm horizontally distant in area 17 is less than 30 degrees, which is of the order of an individual cells orientation selectivity. Each cell, therefore, will respond to some extent to that orientation which is preferred by the cells in the immediate surroundings. 3. Sequential changes in the preferred orientation between cells successively recorded are observed as the postlateral gyrus is explored from anterior to posterior and from medial to lateral. On these general trends a random variation in the preferred orientation between neighbouring cells of the order of 5\u201310 degrees is superimposed. One orientation sequence (180 degrees) occupies 700\u20131200 \u03bcm, so that on the average a change in the preferred orientation of the order of 10 degrees is complete after 50 \u03bcm distance in the cortex measured parallel to the pial surface.

Taking an average orientation selectivity of 40 degrees for cells vertically aligned in area 17 it is calculated that cells situated 100 \u03bcm to either side of an iso-orientation band or around an iso-orientation spot still respond with 50% of the discharge to their own optimal orientation. 5.

The sensitivity to the orientation functionally represented by the subunit decreases with increasing distance from the center band, and from the center spot, respectively.

Several investigatorsa,3,v,9,12 have noted radioactive substances in the postsynaptic ceils, which suggests that these cells take up labeled material released from the terminals 1,3,7. Grafstein 4 was the first to explore the possibility of tracing a pathway beyond the terminals of the initially labeled cells, by examining also the projections of the recipient postsynaptic neurons. By radiochemical measurements and by autoradiog-raphy, it was shown that after injection of [3H]proline and [aH]fucose into one eye of a mouse the contralateral striate cortex was more heavily labeled than the ipsilateral, and that the label was concentrated in layer IV 5,14. In the macaque monkey the geniculostriate pathway terminates in a very dense, highly localized manner, mainly in layer IV C. Furthermore, projections from the 2 eyes end in a characteristic alternating stripe-like pattern of ocular-dominance columns s. It occurred to us that if radioactive substances were transported transneuronally, injection of labeled material into one eye followed by autoradiog-raphy of the cortex might reveal the entire system of ocular-dominance columns. For the autoradiographic study of transneuronal transport in the primate visual system, 50/~1 of a saline solution containing L-[6-3H]fucose (2.5 mCi/ml, 13.4Ci/ mmole) and L-[3H]proline (7.5 mCi/ml, generally labeled, 6.8 Ci/mmole) was injected into the vitreous of the left eye ofa 3 kg normal Rhesus macaque. This injection was repeated 5 times at 12 h intervals (total dose 3.0 mCi). The animal was perfused with 10 ~ formalin 3 weeks after the initial injection. The lateral geniculate nucleus was cut into 20 #m frozen sections, and the striate cortex was embedded in paraffin and cut into 15/~m sections. The sections were coated with Ilford K5 emulsion, left in the dark for 2-4 months and developed in Dektol. Sections were counter-stained with thionin. In the lateral geniculate nucleus all layers receiving projections from the injected eye were strongly labeled (Fig. l A and B).

Hubel", "Torsten N. Wiesel"], "date": "1975", "abstract": "A pattern of alternating dark and pale bands was observed in the striate cortex of the macaque monkey. The bands, which ran parallel to the surface, were seen in tangential sections stained with a reduced silver method for normal fibers and were most clear in layer 4C alpha, immediately deep to the line of Gennari. The dark bands were about 300 mu wide and showed blind endings and bifurcations. The light bands were about 50 mu wide and did not branch or terminate within area 17. Because the dark bands were similar in width to the bands of terminal degeneration which have been shown to result from single-layer lesions of the lateral geniculate body, it seemed possible that they corresponded to ocular dominance columns. To test this idea, the boundaries of ocular dominance columns were marked in a physiological experiment: tangential electrode penetrations were made in an anesthetized monkey and, as the electrode was advanced horizontally in the fourth layer, the eye preference of single units and of the background activity was monitored. Small electrolytic lesions were placed at the points where a change in eye preference occurred. The brain was subsequently fixed, sectioned tangentially and stained with the silver method. All the lesions--total of 12 --fell directly on the pale bands. Moreover, the electrode had not passed over any pale bands without a lesion being placed. It was concluded that the dark bands do correspond to single ocular dominance columns and the pale bands to the boundaries between columns. The banding appearance is due to a greater density of tangential fibers within columns than at the borders of columns. These tangential fibers are in part the preterminal arborizations of geniculocortical axons, since some of them have been shown to degenerate after geniculate lesions. The ocular dominance columns were mapped for most of the striate cortex, using serial tangential sections stained with the silver method. The overall pattern was ,imilar in several monkeys, though the details of the branching arrangements varied from animal to animal. The columns met the 17-18 border at right angles. On the outer surface of the hemisphere the columns converged from the 17-18 border, turned medially with repeated fusions of columns, and streamed over the lip of the calcarine fissure. In the roof of the fissure they met a second system of columns oriented parasagittally. In terms of the visual field, the columns ran roughly horizontally for the central 10 degrees of the field, and circumferentially beyond that. The columns were not mapped in the stem of the fissure, the area corresponding to the far periphery of the field. The constancy of column width across the cortex probably allows a functional matching between ocular-dominance and orientation columns.", "references": ["Binocular-interaction-in-striate-cortex-of-kittens-Hubel-Wiesel/76e4b735610508f33ab1cb5148efeb20bcd19bcc"]},

Here the terminals were distributed within the superficial grey layer of the tectum at a depth extending from about 50 mum to 125 mum and in a patchy fashion, with a tendency to aggregation in clumps 0.1-0.5 mm wide from one or other eye. Further posteromedially, corresponding to more peripheral retinal regions, the input from the contralateral eye became more continuous superficially, with tongues extending more deeply in the superficial grey, apparently enclosing clumps of ipsilateral terminals. These deeper ipsilateral clumps occupied a rather well defined layer extending in depth from about 100 mum to about 175 mum.

Spontaneously active inputs to X- and Y-cells.", "authors": ["David N. Mastronarde"], "date": "1983", "abstract": "1. The shared inputs to cat retinal ganglion cells have been investigated by studying correlations in the maintained firing of neighboring ganglion cells. The firing of one cell was recorded from its axon in the optic tract, while that of a neighboring cell was simultaneously recorded with a second electrode in the retina. The recorded cells were of the X- or Y-type and viewed a uniform screen having a luminance of 10 cd/m2. 2. Ganglion cells with overlapping receptive-field centers showed two basic forms of correlated firing: if they had the same center sign (both on-center or both off-center), then they tended to fire at the same time, as shown by a peak in their cross-correlogram; but if they had opposite center signs (an on- and and off-center cell), they tended not to fire at the same time, as shown by a well, or dip, in their cross-correlogram. 3. Both of these tendencies were strongest for cells that were close together and did not appear for cells with nonoverlapping receptive-field centers. The strongest correlations were between neighboring Y-cells, cells with large fields, and the weakest were between X-cells, cells with small fields. In general, the strength of the correlations depended primarily on the area of the overlap between fields. 4. These correlations in maintained firing appear to be principally or entirely caused by shared inputs to the ganglion cells from more distal retinal neurons. The signals from these distal neurons appear to have strong, brief (4-8 ms), well-defined effects on ganglion cells, which are observed even in the absence of a visual stimulus. The inputs responsible for the correlated firing are thus referred to as spontaneously active inputs or simply as active inputs. 5. An analysis of the features in the various types of cross-correlograms supports the following statements about these spontaneously active inputs. a) There are two types of active inputs: inputs excitatory to on-center cells and simultaneously inhibitory to off-center center cells and inputs excitatory to off-center cells and simultaneously inhibitory to on-center cells. b) The active inputs of each type provide excitation to both X- and Y-cells of one center sign and inhibition to both X- and Y-cells of the other center sign. There is no evidence for a special class of more selective inputs providing input only to X-cells or only to Y-cells. c) Active inputs account for the majority (about 80%) of the spikes in the maintained activity of Y-cells but only a small fraction (about 15%) of the spikes in the maintained activity of X-cells. 6. A likely source of the active input signals appears to be spiking amacrine cells with a low rate of spontaneous activity.", "references": []},

Maps for different hemispheres from individuals of the same species are similar in size, shape, and organization, and their configuration is largely independent of the plane of sectioning used for reconstruction. Many types of information pertaining to the location and organization of different functional subdivisions can be displayed on cortical maps; representative applications of the technique to mapping cerebral cortex in the macaque and the cat are shown. Areal measurements on cortical maps correspond closely (generally within 20%) to actual surface areas in the intact hemisphere. Therefore, the maps can also be used to provide accurate determinations of the absolute and relative extent of various anatomical and functional subdivisions of the cortex.", "references": []},

The cells of origin of callosal fibers in SI are largely confined to layer IIIB and form columns and strips corresponding to the above. In connected zones of SI, the callosal connection is reciprocal and precisely point-to point.

They proposed that this pattern might be due to populations of neurons with long-range cortico-cortical connections that are interspersed with populations having no such connections. We suggest here an alternative explanation. We can account for the pattern by supposing that the label is carrier by a system of oriented axons. We suppose that these axons link cells with similar orientation preferences and make their connections within a narrow strip of cortex whose direction is related to the orientation of the cells in question. We suggest that such connections could be involved in generating complex receptive fields from simple ones. Other possibilities are that they are used to generate very elongated receptive fields, inhibitory flanks, or end-stopping. We suggest a number of experimental tests of these ideas.", "references": []},

The results confirm earlier findings that the projections of the magnocellular and parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate body terminate in separate sublaminae of layer IV of striate cortex; a more superficial projection of the parvocellular layers to a narrow strip at the base of layer III (IVA in Brodmann's terminology) has also been confirmed. In addition to these well characterized pathways, our results show that the projections of the lateral geniculate body terminate in more superficial levels of layer III and sparsely in layer I of striate cortex. The projections to the upper portion of layer III terminate in distinct patches which coincide precisely with patches of cytochrome oxidase activity previously identified in this zone. The projections to the patches originate primarily from small, pale-staining cells of the \"intercalated layers\" which surround the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate body. A comparison of the organization of the geniculo-cortical projections in the squirrel monkey with that of the cat, Galago, and Tupaia suggests that, despite marked species differences in the laminar organization of the lateral geniculate body and striate cortex, there are striking similarities in the pathway which terminates in the most superficial layers of striate cortex.", "references": ["The-retino-geniculo-cortical-pathway-in-callithrix-Spatz/ffd65040091141082d1f9ed3489abc72506c9935", "Laminar-and-columnar-distribution-of-fibers-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/e5f4f49721eb3f6bdba304a06728327631e832bb", "Laminar-organization-of-receptive-field-properties-Norton-Casagrande/998ac5ece36af5ff489002d00ab8bf40b0684f4a", "The-projection-of-the-primate-superior-colliculus-Harting-Casagrande/e488c85f6ac2f466b4d4eb03c1bee9f76b7ac257", "Plasticity-of-ocular-dominance-columns-in-monkey-Hubel-Wiesel/ea2fa92fbef1ca570ae093f751ecb2e0bcfb67b8", "Termination-of-afferent-axons-in-macaque-striate-Blasdel-Lund/e50fbd28a3748e31e28b0cd0d37c398e98ea771e", "The-projections-of-the-lateral-geniculate-nucleus-S-Weber-Huerta/c548768327ee6ba54a03a6e761d1cfe092a33962"]},

Malpeli", "Frank H Baker"], "date": "1975", "abstract": "Microelectrode recording techniques were used to investigate the projection of the visual field into the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of Macaca mulatta. The data were used to construct charts plotting visual direction, designated in terms of azimuth and elevation, onto sections of the nucleus cut in coronal, sagittal and horizontal Horsley-Clarke planes. The projection of the horizontal meridian divides the LGN along its plane of symmetry into a medial-superior half having negative elevations and a lateral-inferior half having positive elevations. Elevations become more positive or negative with distance from this plane. Azimuths closest to the vertical meridian are located posteriorly, while the most peripheral azimuths are found at the anterior pole. Two families of surfaces representing visual directions of constant azimuth and elevation are described. Visual field zones of increasing eccentricity are represented serially along the posterior-anterior axis of the LGN, with the foveal area restricted to the posterior pole and the monocular crescent projecting to the anterior pole. The mapping is completely continuous across the horizontal meridian. The edges of the stacked cell laminae exposed around the periphery of the LGN form an oval band which receives the projection of the perimeter of the contralateral hemifield. The vertical meridian is represented by the posterior two-thirds of this band, while the periphery of the hemifield projects to the anterior third. The central visual field out to the optic disc is represented by six cell layers, while the rest of the binocular field projects to four layers only (2 parvocellular and 2 magnocellular). The monocular crescent is represented by one parvocellular and one magnocellular layer. Features associated with the projection column of the optic disc are integrated into the transition from six to four layers. Details of the receptive field topography in the vicinity of the optic disc discontinuities indicate that these gaps are produced by intralaminar mechanisms. The magnification factor (mm-3/steradian) increased monotonically from peripheral visual fields to the foveal center, varying over a range of three decades. This range is intermediate between those derived from data reported in the literature for the retina and the striate cortex. The ratio of LGN magnifications at any two angular eccentricities is a power function, with an exponent of 1.34, of the corresponding ratio of retinal ganglion cell densities. Similarly, the ratio of cortical magnifications (mm-2/steradian) at any two eccentricites is a power function, with an exponent of 1.35, of the corresponding ratio of LGN magnifications.", "references": []},

The topographic representation of the visual filed was similar to what has been found in other mammals, with the temporal part of the contralateral visual field projecting posteriorly and the inferior visual field projecting laterally. At the anterior margin of the tectum receptive fields recorded through the contralateral eye and invaded the ipsilateral visual hemifield for up to 35 degrees, suggesting that the entire visual field through one eye is represented on the contralateral superior colliculus. Cells located closest to the tectal surface had relatively small receptive fields, averaging 9 degrees in center diameter; field sizes increased steadily with depth. The prevailing cell type in the stratum zonal and superficial gray responded best to a small dark or light object of any shape moved slowly through the receptive-field center or to turning a small stationary spot on or off. Large objects or diffuse light were usually much less effective. Less than one-quarter of superficial layer cells showed directional selectivity to a moving object, the majority of these favoring up and nasal movement. The chief visual cell type in the stratum opticum and upper part of the intermediate gray resembled in the newness neurons described for many other vertebrates: they had large receptive fields and responded best to up and nasal movement of a small dark or light object, whose optimal size was similar to the optimum for upper-layer cells. If the same part of the receptive field was repeatedly stimulated there was a marked tendency to habituate. Only very few cels responded to the ipsilateral eye. Intermixed with visual cells in the upper part of the intermediate gray were cells that responded to somatosensory or auditory stimuli. Here bimodal and trimodal cells were also seen. In deeper layers somatosensory and auditory modalities tended to take over. These two modalities were not segregated into sublayers but rather seemed to be arranged in clusters.

The optimal orientation for a single cell is not necessarily identical on both retinae. For a large sample of cells there is a range of more than + 15 degrees (S.D. about 6-9 degrees ) in the difference of preferred orientation in the two eyes. These interocular differences in receptive field properties cannot be attributed to rotation of the eyes or to the errors of measurement.4. During simultaneous binocular stimulation the images must not only lie in the correct place on both retinae but also have exactly the right orientation for both receptive fields in order to elicit the maximum response from a neurone.5. Therefore certain binocular cells respond specifically to objects tilted in three-dimensional space towards the cat, or away from it.", "references": []},

Hubel and Wiesel,' in their classical papers, differentiated three categories of cells in the cat's striate cortex. They further suggested a hierarchical model which would explain the organization of the receptive fields of each type of cell. Thus only simple cells would receive a direct excitatory input from lateral geniculate neurons (LGN), and a number of simple cells with a common optimal orientation and slightly offset receptive-field positions would then provide the excitatory input to the complex cells. Finally, different complex cells with a common preferred orientation but again with offset receptive-field positions would provide excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the hypercomplex cells. The inhibitory input to the hypercomplex cell would explain that the sharp reduction in the discharge, as an optimally oriented stimulus, is elongated beyond the excitatory region in the receptive field. If the Hubel and Wiesel model is correct, one would expect a basic similarity between the responses of complex and hypercomplex cells. However, on the basis of the organization of their receptive field, we have been able to differentiate four classes of cells in the cat's striate cortex: simple, complex, and two distinct classes of hypercomplex cells. The majority of hypercomplex cells (Fig. 1, Type 1) have responses very similar to those of simple cells and their receptive fields can be subdivided into", "references": ["Striate-neurons%3A-receptive-field-concepts.-Bishop-Henry/91d86e4cfb56c8b604b59f14760f471362b4ee9b", "Conduction-velocity-of-afferents-to-cat-visual-a-Hoffman-Stone/358ac9a79a0b53fd424150b8dd54d38ed6c2113b", "Sustained-and-transient-neurones-in-the-cat's-and-Cleland-Dubin/9afb344a5dfc0592cd31d8184a1828e100e68ef0", "Receptive-fields-and-functional-architecture-of-Hubel-Wiesel/1116467d67f475d1bd2539862f10f792032fe13b", "Receptive-Fields-and-Functional-Architecture-in-Two-Hubel-Wiesel/f70c54029c17f50914996c834930ecbfacda195f", "Receptive-fields%2C-binocular-interaction-and-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/6b4fe4aa4d66fecc7b2869569002714d91d0b3f7"]},

Gilbert", "Torsten N. Wiesel"], "date": "1983", "abstract": "The intrinsic connections of the cortex have long been known to run vertically, across the cortical layers. In the present study we have found that individual neurons in the cat primary visual cortex can communicate over suprisingly long distances horizontally (up to 4 mm), in directions parallel to the cortical surface. For all of the cells having widespread projections, the collaterals within their axonal fields were distributed in repeating clusters, with an average periodicity of 1 mm. This pattern of extensive clustered projections has been revealed by combining the techniques of intracellular recording and injection of horseradish peroxidase with three-dimensional computer graphic reconstructions. The clustering pattern was most apparent when the cells were rotated to present a view parallel to the cortical surface. The pattern was observed in more than half of the pyramidal and spiny stellate cells in the cortex and was seen in all cortical layers. In our sample, cells made distant connections within their own layer and/or within another layer. The axon of one cell had clusters covering the same area in two layers, and the clusters in the deeper layer were located under those in the upper layer, suggesting a relationship between the clustering phenomenon and columnar cortical architecture. Some pyramidal cells did not project into the white matter, forming intrinsic connections exclusively. Finally, the axonal fields of all our injected cells were asymmetric, extending for greater distances along one cortical axis than along the orthogonal axis. The axons appeared to cover areas of cortex representing a larger part of the visual field than that covered by the excitatory portion of the cell's own receptive field. These connections may be used to generate larger receptive fields or to produce the inhibitory flanks in other cells' receptive fields.", "references": []},

In squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) that binocularly or monocularly viewed diffuse white light or binocularly viewed bars of many orientations and spatial frequencies, 2-DG consumption was not uniform across the cortex but consisted of regularly spaced radial zones of high uptake. The zones extended through all laminae except IVc beta and, when viewed tangentially, formed separate patches 500 microns apart. The cytochrome oxidase stain in these animals also revealed patches of high metabolism which coincided with the 2-DG patches. Squirrel monkeys binocularly viewing vertical stripes showed parallel bands of increased 2-DG uptake in the cortex, while the cytochrome label in these animals remained patchy. When monkeys were kept in the dark during 2-DG exposure, 2-DG-labeled patches were not seen but cytochrome oxidase-positive patches remained. In macaque (Macaca nemestrina) monkeys, binocular stimulation with many orientations and spatial frequencies produced radial zones of high 2-DG uptake in layers I to IVa and VI. When viewed tangentially, these zones formed a dots-in-rows pattern with a spacing of 350 X 500 microns; cytochrome oxidase staining produced an identical pattern. Macaca differed from Saimiri in that monocular stimulation labeled alternate rows. These results indicate that there are radial zones of high background metabolism across squirrel and macaque monkey striate cortex. In Saimiri these zones do not appear to be related to an eye dominance system, while in Macaca they do. The presence of these zones of high metabolism may complicate the interpretation of 2-DG autoradiographs that result from specific visual stimuli.", "references": ["Physiological-evidence-that-the-2-deoxyglucose-in-Schoppmann-Stryker/4a1c5da82184949b096b4504aac3d810a755c57a", "Anatomical-demonstration-of-orientation-columns-in-Hubel-Wiesel/4a230999d0a78206943a0c717ccacb5e2ad8b83a", "14C-Deoxyglucose-mapping-of-orientation-subunits-in-Albus/ed517a9863bbae1510cdaa325e92c6a7f74dbdb7", "Demonstration-of-orientation-columns-with-in-a-cat-Flood-Coleman/c385cd6a517c692f7e0d50673487a12e558f95e8", "Metabolic-mapping-of-the-primary-visual-system-of-Kennedy-Rosiers/41217f39d679b7cf790d3f253e925af3d5157385"]},

Cat retinal ganglion cells may be subdivided into sustained and transient response-types by the application of a battery of simple tests based on responses to standing contrast, fine grating patterns, size and speed of contrasting targets, and on the presence or absence of the periphery effect. The classification is equivalent to the ;X'/;Y' (linear/nonlinear) subdivision of Enroth-Cugell & Robson which is thus confirmed and extended.2. The sustained/transient classification applied to both on-centre and off-centre cells.3. Lateral geniculate neurones may be similarly classified by the same tests. Occasional concentrically organized cells had a mixture of sustained and transient properties.4. A technique for simultaneous recording from a geniculate neurone and one or more retinal ganglion cells providing its excitatory input showed that the connexions were specific with respect to the sustained/transient classification as well as the on-centre/off-centre classification. Most geniculate neurones are excitatorily driven only by retinal ganglion cells of the same functional type. In a few cases the inputs were mixed but only with respect to the sustained/transient classification.5. Sustained retinal ganglion cells had slower-conducting axons than the transient type. The same was true for lateral geniculate neurones but in this case the distributions showed considerable overlap.6. The sustained/transient classification is the functional correlate for the well-known segregation of optic nerve fibres into two conduction groups.7. The pathways carrying sustained and transient information remain essentially separate from retina through the lateral geniculate nucleus to the striate cortex.", "references": []},

Spatially compact objects are presently modeled with some success at realism. Because terrain is large in extent it exhibits special problems. These problems include: data base size and generation, masking priority, and shading.\n An array of height values can be created from the DMA terrain file. Height is a single valued function of the array coordinate pair. The pair has implicit positional information. A masking priority algorithm is used which has no restriction on observer geometry. The algorithm searches the height array along the line of sight for the first visible position in the array. This approach requires no clipping or depth sorting of surface representations. The height array indices are used to access the pixel shade from a registered, orthonormal texture array. The use of texture provides a simple way to add nonlinear shading for a realistic representation with flexible data base generation.\n Atmospheric attenuation is a method used to increase realism. Methods are in use which produce haze or fog with constant attenuation. The line-of-sight search is used to produce realistic clouds with spatially variable attenuation.\n Terrain and clouds are adequately simulated using this method of modeling. The data structures of height and texture arrays are simple, easily generated, and make good use of storage resources. Resolving masking priority along the line of sight is a visible surface algorithm which has advantages over hidden surface algorithms. Realistic representations such as texture and atmospheric attenuation are used with some success.", "references": []},

A critical, intermediate goal of edge detection is the detection and characterization of significant intensity changes. This paper discusses this part of the edge detection problem. To characterize the types of intensity changes derivatives of different types, and possibly different scales, are needed. Thus, we consider this part of edge detection as a problem in numerical differentiation. We show that numerical differentiation of images is an ill-posed problem in the sense of Hadamard. Differentiation needs to be regularized by a regularizing filtering operation before differentiation. This shows that this part of edge detection consists of two steps, a filtering step and a differentiation step. Following this perspective, the paper discusses in detail the following theoretical aspects of edge detection. 1) The properties of different types of filters-with minimal uncertainty, with a bandpass spectrum, and with limited support-are derived. Minimal uncertainty filters optimize a tradeoff between computational efficiency and regularizing properties. 2) Relationships among several 2-D differential operators are established. In particular, we characterize the relation between the Laplacian and the second directional derivative along the gradient. Zero crossings of the Laplacian are not the only features computed in early vision. 3) Geometrical and topological properties of the zero crossings of differential operators are studied in terms of transversality and Morse theory.", "references": ["The-Curvature-Primal-Sketch-Asada-Brady/3b698e9255b2e4837511772a4e574b06a78863d9", "Uniqueness-of-the-Gaussian-Kernel-for-Scale-Space-Babaud-Witkin/fd9c54a47a6763ddf1a1d0fa7ba2323d3d871a6b", "Uncertainty-relation-for-resolution-in-space%2C-and-Daugman/02f89cd1fd6f013a1a301a292936ff8fb06aff25", "Reconstruction-of-Multidimensional-Signals-from-Curtis/cdc873d9ada2100d0acae6580733531098740e0b"]},

These 'shift responses' are not caused by fluctuations of stray light because (a) they cannot be reduced by deliberately increasing or decreasing the light falling on the receptive field synchronously with the shifting grating; (b) a steady adapting light applied to the receptive field does not raise the threshold for the responses, whereas adapting light on the peripheral retina does, and (c) the threshold for the responses is elevated more following bleaching adaptation of the periphery than following bleaching adaptation of the centre. 4. Shift responses are strong, of short latency, and brief in duration in brisk-transient (Y-type) neurones. With few exceptions they are weak but long-lasting in brisk-sustained (X-type) neurones. 5. Shift responses are unlike responses from the main receptive field in having a distinct threshold; the magnitude of the response to weak gratings is not simply proportional to contrast, as is the case with weak stimuli applied to the receptive field. 6.

V. Papoulias"], "date": "1986", "abstract": "Scale-space filtering (Witkin 83) is a recently developed technique, both powerful and general, for segmentation and analysis of signals. Asada and Brady (84) have amply demonstrated the value of scale-space for description of curved contours from digitised images . Weak continuity constraints (Blake 83a,b, Blake and Zisserman 85,87) furnish novel, powerful, non-linear filters , to use in place of gaussians, for scale-space filtering. This has some striking advantages (fig 1). First, scale-space is uniform, so that tracking across scale is a trivial task. Structure need not be preserved to indefinitely fine scale; this leads to an enrichment of the concept of scale a rounded corner, for example, can be represented as a discontinuity at coarse scale but smooth at fine scale. And finally boundary conditions at ends of curves are handled satisfactorily it is as easy to analyse open curves as closed ones. 1 Weak continuity constraints Weak continuity constraints are a principled and effective treatment of the localisation of discontinuities in discrete data. Detailed discussions are given in (Blake 83a, Blake 83b, Blake and Zisserman 85, Blake and Zisserman 87). Applications in computer vision include curve description, edge detection, reconstruction of 2~D surfaces from stereo or laser-rangefinder data, and others. This paper deals with the application of weak continuity constraints to description of plane curves. First a brief summary of weak continuity constraints is given for problems like curve description, in which the data is a 1D array. Data may be obtained from a plane curve as an array (Ji of tangent angle values at equal spacings in arc-length s . The problem is to localise discontinuities in noisy, discrete data. The notion of a discontinuity applies to functions, not to discrete arrays so the problem is ill-posed, and this is exacerbated by the presence of noise. One solution is to interpolate the data by a smooth function such as a gaussian, whose 1st derivative can then be examined. Of course this is common practice in edge detection and in spline interpolation (e.g. de Boor 78) . Such smoothing can be regarded as fitting a function u(s) which tends to seek a minimum of some elastic energy P. Energy P is traded off against a sum of squares error measure D , defined as : D = ~i(U(Si) (Ji)2 by minimising variationally the total energy (or cost) P+ D. The result is a function u(s) that is both fairly smooth and is a fair approximation to the data (}i. The simplest form of the energy P is that of a horizontal stretched string (approximately) : where the parameter A governs the stiffness of the string. If.>. is large then the tendency to smoothness overwhelms the tendency (from D) to approximate the data well. In the extremes, if'>' is very large, the fitted function is simply u = canst , the least squares regression of a constant function to the data (Ji; but if .>. ~ 0 then u interpolates the data, linking the (Ji by straight lines. Weak continuity constraints can be applied to a scheme like the one above, to incorporate discontinuities explicitly into the fitting of u above. Rather than fitting a u that is smooth everywhere and then examining the gradient u' , the function u is allowed to break (at knots, in spline jargon) it is piecewise continuous. The number and position of the discontinuities is chosen optimally, by using an augmented form of cost function E = D + P + S, where the additional term S embodies weak continuity constraints: s = n' X (number of discontinuities) a fixed penalty a is paid for each discontinuity allowed. This has the effect of discouraging discontinuities; u is continuous \"almost everywhere\". But an occasional discontinuity may be allowed if there is sufficient benefit in terms of smoothness (P) and faithfulness to data (D) in so doing . Clearly a is some kind of measure of reluctance to allow a discontinuity. In fact the two parameters a,'>' interact in a rather interesting way. Far from being \"fudge factors\" that must be empirically set, they have clear interpretations in terms of", "references": ["Localising-discontinuities-using-weak-continuity-Blake-Zisserman/5789289192e1325429832f25158b56969acada4e", "The-Curvature-Primal-Sketch-Asada-Brady/3b698e9255b2e4837511772a4e574b06a78863d9", "Stochastic-Relaxation%2C-Gibbs-Distributions%2C-and-the-Geman-Geman/2408a19a13fcd4f76b2fe0b5d654fe5c276e6f0e", "Multilevel-computational-processes-for-visual-Terzopoulos/a931f49f06fdc0c5b339de9fb8e9e496ac98a300", "Scale-Space-Filtering-Witkin/a26f893c224ed6e3df1f37479de0e774a4cae237", "The-least-disturbance-principle-and-weak-Blake/1821de90c72c557f5bd874a4f7420c07d6220363"]},

Through regularization, they may be reformulated as well-posed variational principles whose solutions are computable. Standard regularization theory employs quadratic stabilizing functionals that impose global smoothness constraints on possible solutions. Discontinuities present serious difficulties to standard regularization, however, since their reconstruction requires a precise spatial control over the smoothing properties of stabilizers. This paper proposes a general class of controlled-continuity stabilizers which provide the necessary control over smoothness. These nonquadratic stabilizing functionals comprise multiple generalized spline kernels combined with (noncontinuous) continuity control functions. In the context of computational vision, they may be thought of as controlled-continuity constraints.

The theoretical lower limit for the joint entropy, or uncertainty, of these variables is achieved by an optimal 2D filter family whose spatial weighting functions are generated by exponentiated bivariate second-order polynomials with complex coefficients, the elliptic generalization of the one-dimensional elementary functions proposed in Gabor's famous theory of communication [J. Inst. Electr. Eng. 93, 429 (1946)]. The set includes filters with various orientation bandwidths, spatial-frequency bandwidths, and spatial dimensions, favoring the extraction of various kinds of information from an image. Each such filter occupies an irreducible quantal volume (corresponding to an independent datum) in a four-dimensional information hyperspace whose axes are interpretable as 2D visual space, orientation, and spatial frequency, and thus such a filter set could subserve an optimally efficient sampling of these variables. Evidence is presented that the 2D receptive-field profiles of simple cells in mammalian visual cortex are well described by members of this optimal 2D filter family, and thus such visual neurons could be said to optimize the general uncertainty relations for joint 2D-spatial-2D-spectral information resolution. The variety of their receptive-field dimensions and orientation and spatial-frequency bandwidths, and the correlations among these, reveal several underlying constraints, particularly in width/length aspect ratio and principal axis organization, suggesting a polar division of labor in occupying the quantal volumes of information hyperspace.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "references": ["Sequence-regularity-and-geometry-of-orientation-in-Hubel-Wiesel/1c387b70f37fd902735e6c2b76d9715a251d1b5e", "Application-of-Fourier-analysis-to-the-visibility-Campbell-Robson/ddc2ea63fa69eca4aa44a4fd135543d67badcb23", "Receptive-fields%2C-binocular-interaction-and-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/6b4fe4aa4d66fecc7b2869569002714d91d0b3f7", "Periodic-simple-cells-in-cat-area-17.-Mullikin-Jones/fa36540d6edf66a70dedc88a3ca7bd050c905a2c", "A-model-for-the-economical-encoding-of-the-visual-Sakitt-Barlow/6d346fa98748dd1ee5435e8ee46698356d3c6596", "Theory-of-spatial-position-and-spatial-frequency-in-Kulikowski-Mar%C4%8Delja/e26aaa33c6615d90a9b02ecbe5d776f5e712c582", "Fourier-analysis-and-spatial-representation-in-the-Kulikowski-Bishop/9b9ea2851317fba2ba4d347775525188117096de", "Phase-relationships-between-adjacent-simple-cells-Pollen-Ronner/395922dfc5de5296d6d2a93954989e2c8b1b8163", "Spatial-frequency-columns-in-primary-visual-cortex.-Tootell-Silverman/65572049ca33584afd6add752d1ee0f64d320119"]},

Kr\u00fcger", "Burkhart Fischer"], "date": "1976", "abstract": "An optical stimulator has been developed and successfully used for the past 2 yr in single unit studies of the visual system of cats, rabbits and monkeys. The principal advantage of the system \u2018is that the color and brightness inside and outside a variable contour can be chosen independently. The overall principle of the employed mirror technique has been in use for some time in comparison photometers and was applied to physiological studies by others (e.g. Spelcreijse, van der Tweel and Zuidema, 1973). With the aid of the present system, the study of receptive field properties is greatly facilitated because it allows for rapid and continuous changes of stimulus contours, orientation and movement. The layout of the projector is depicted in Fig. 1. Two identical subunits which can also be used separately are incorporated in the apparatus. Each subunit (Fig. la) is supplied by a light-flux controlled 900 W xenon arc lamp (Schoeffel, D 2351 Trappenlcamp). Light is collected in two perpendicular directions by quartz glass condensers accepting 70\u201d of the incident light. The nearly parallel rays of light pass through three heat filters each 2mm thick (two KG2, one KG 3). Neutral density filters in steps of 1 and 0.1 log units, interference lilters between 660 and 405 nm wavelength or an occluder can be placed in the beam. (Heat, neutral, and color filters from Schott & Gen., Maim.) TWO lenses focus the two perpendicular beams at the same point. A 20 x 20mm quartz glass mirror driven by a fast galvanometer can be moved at an angle of 45\u201d into this focal point, thus interchanging the two output beams within less than 4msec. A similar technique has been used by Jacobs (1965). The mirror may also be halted in a halfway position, permitting the superposition of two di&ent colors. With the aid of an additional electrical shutter (not shown) introduced into the output beam of a light source subunit a sequence of on-off stimuli alternating between two colors and/or two luminances can be obtained. Two neural responses can then be immediately compared. This technique is advantageous in the case of unstable recording conditions. For stimulation by local decrement flashes or spatial color contrast the patterns projected from the main object plane are mirrors with apertures such as holes or slits. The lower beam (see Fig. lb) determines the luminance, color and time control inside the aperture (center part of the stimulus) the upper beam reflected from the mirror determines the surround. The mirrors are manufactured by applying a standard aluminium and quartz coating (Heraeus, Hanau) to untreated smooth Makrolon@ (Bayer, Leverkusen). Circular stimuli with ditTerent diameters are available on a turntable which is placed in the object plane. The borders of the conical holes are sharp to less than 0.05mm. Fine adjustment of the xenon arc lamp currents permits precise luminosity matching. Generally the width of the remaining visible border separating center and surround is less than l/2000 of the total projected field diameter. Rectangular and rectilinear stimuli such as slits and long edges are obtained by the projection of two superposed L-shaped mirrors. Stimulus dimensions are easily varied by translation of the mirrors against each other in the two horizontal dimensions. All patterns projected from the main object plane can be mamrally tilted by a Dove prism. The patterns can be swept over the projection screen by the aid of a galvanometer\u2019driven mirror. Swept or gashed ~ectangular stimuli with minimal dimensions of 2 x 2 visual angle can be obtained. Other stimulus shapes, including e.g. photographs or gratings, are obtained by photo-etching of ordinary mirrors. The residual retlection from the glass surt&es, however, precludes the attainment of looO/, contrast for upper beam illumination alone. A variety of objects can be projected onto the screen by using the lower beam alone. In particular, cellophane sheets supporting gratings or other patterns can be moved by a galvanometer motor. The whole, compact motor device can be located in the main object plane. This method has the advantage that stationary and moving objects may be projected simultaneously from the same object plane. Objects made from ~/2birefringent material such as household cellophane are of particular interest, because the switching of a beam from one to another polarisation orientation or from polarized to unpolarized light yields simultaneous light changes in different parts of the stimulus pattern. A bipartite field can be switched from a homogeneous illumination to an increment in one half field and a decrement in the other half, keeping the total light fiux constant When different stimuli are projected from the main and secondary object planes, both beams together can be centered on a receptive field by the same large manual image displacement mirror which is mounted on a roughly spherical automobile hub cap resting", "references": []},

Some cells show this spatial antagonism at threshold; others require suprathreshold stimuli for its demonstration.2. The majority of cells in layer 4B do not show orientation or directional selectivity. The proportion of cells with orientation and directional selectivity increases and the proportion of opponent-colour cells decreases with increasing distance above and below layer 4B so that the majority of cells in the outer layers exhibit considerable spatial selectivity without apparent colour opponency. These changing proportions suggest that the latter cells may be receiving their inputs from different types of opponent-colour cells making them sensitive to different types of colour contrast but not to colour per se.3. More opponent-colour cells receive inputs from the red- and green- sensitive cone mechanisms than from the blue-sensitive one. This difference is more marked in layer 4B than 3B suggesting that the latter cortical layer may be more involved in colour vision than the former.", "references": []},

The functional basis for a sustained/transient classification of cat retinal ganglion cells has been strengthened by quantitative measurements of the sizes of the centre and surround components of receptive fields. Transient cells had larger surrounds than sustained; the distributions were non-overlapping. Although the distributions of centre sizes overlapped, the transient cells had very significantly larger centres on average.2. There were characteristic differences in area-threshold and annulus-threshold curves and shapes of responses to brief and long flashes of light, and relative differences in the nature of surround adaptation and maintained discharge rates.3. The distinction of sustained from transient units survived over a wide range of backgrounds including the two principle reorganizations of function: relative weakening of surround components at low background; Purkinje shift at high.4. Sustained and transient units were differentially distributed in the retina: there was an overwhelming preponderance of sustained units in the area centralis.5. It is proposed that the transient units are the so-called multidendritedeep cells and the sustained units are the variously styled small ganglion cells.", "references": []},

The size, shape, and spacing of the excitatory regions within these receptive fields were highly regular, giving the receptive field a periodic appearance in space. We call these periodic simple cells. A periodic simple cell's response to moving stimuli could, in general, be anticipated from the detailed spatiotemporal map of excitatory and inhibitory regions provided by response planes. This observation suggests that periodic simple cells, like the more common simple cells composed of one to three excitatory regions, sum spatially distributed inputs in a roughly linear manner. Based on a quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and time course of response of single excitatory regions within periodic receptive fields, as described in the previous paper, we characterized periodic simple cells as either X-like or Y-like. Furthermore, we found that periodic simple cells classified as X-like gave a more sustained response to standing contrast and had significantly smaller excitatory regions than those cells classified as Y-like. Periodic simple cells were found in layer III and at the border between layers III and IVab. It is suggested that these cells, which reside outside the primary zone of geniculate termination and include both X-like and Y-like types, may be constructed hierarchically from the convergence of lower order simple cells. In the spatial-frequency domain, periodic simple receptive fields were predicted to have bandwidths at half-maximum ranging from 0.80 to 1.4 octaves. By comparison, the predicted bandwidths of cells composed of two or three excitatory regions ranged from 1.6 to 4.3 octaves. Thus as additional excitatory regions are added to the receptive fields of simple cells, their bandwidth narrows in the spatial-frequency domain.", "references": []},

For accurate localization of these and other cells within the central nervous system, however, it is necessary to record the electrical activity with microelectrodes which have satisfactory electrical properties, and then to indicate the location of the electrode tip by making, while causing a minimum of damage to the area, a small and easily identifiable mark. A number of techniques have been used for locating the position of microelectrode tips in nervous tissue3. However, most of these techniques require special histological procedures, may be unreliable, or can only be used at the end of an experiment. While the method of Galifret and Szabo4 needs no special histological procedure and can be used several times in an experiment, it makes rather large marks (several hundred \u03bc) and has not proved completely reliable.

Entire function models may be studied through the linear expansion techniques (e.g., Fourier series and integrals) familiar to most engineers, but product expansions akin to polynomial factorizations provide a less familiar alternative which is often more powerful when phenomena have a nonlinear character. This paper provides a tutorial introduction to relevant aspects of the theory of entire functions of a single complex variable, and also a discussion of exemplary applications.

Cohen", "Yuri I. Manin", "Don Zagier"], "date": "2004", "abstract": "Introduction. The theme of this paper is the correspondence between classical modular forms and pseudodifferential operators (\u03a8DO\u2019s) which have some kind of automorphic behaviour. In the simplest case, this correspondence is as follows. Let \u0393 be a discrete subgroup of PSL2(R), acting on the complex upper half-plane H in the usual way, and f(z) a modular form of even weight k on \u0393. Then there is a canonical lifting from f to a \u0393-invariant \u03a8DO with leading term f(z) \u2202\u2212k/2 , where \u2202 is the differential operator d dz . This lifting and the fact that the product of two invariant \u03a8DO\u2019s is again an invariant \u03a8DO imply a non-commutative multiplicative structure on the space of all modular forms whose components are scalar multiples of the so-called Rankin-Cohen brackets (canonical bilinear maps on the space of modular forms on \u0393 defined by certain bilinear combinations of derivatives; the definition will be recalled later). This was already discussed briefly in the earlier paper [Z], where it was given as one of several \u201craisons d\u2019\u00eatre\u201d for the Rankin-Cohen brackets. The basic lifting from modular forms to invariant \u03a8DO\u2019s can be interpreted and developed in many ways. We shall discuss some of them in this paper. The two main generalizations are as follows: (I) Just as one generalizes the notion of a modular function to the notion of a modular form, one can consider \u03a8DO\u2019s which are not invariant with respect to \u0393 but instead transform with some automorphy factor. Because of the noncommutativity of \u03a8DO\u2019s, however, we have new possibilities which do not occur in the classical case: one can consider \u201cconjugate-automorphic\u201d \u03a8DO\u2019s which under the action of a fractional linear transformation ( a b", "references": []},

The change is described quantitatively by the cortical magnification factor, which indicates the linear extent of cortex in mm corresponding to one degree of visual angle at various eccentricities (angular distances from the middle fovea). The human cortical magnification factor has been estimated by Cowey and Rolls1 from the data of Brindley and Lewin2, who mapped the phosphenes (sensations of light) caused in the lower nasal visual field by electrical stimulation of the human visual cortex. Building on these results, we have studied the spatial contrast sensitivity functions in man at various eccentricities. We used two methods: in one the retinal image sizes of the test gratings were kept similar at different eccentricities and in the other, the calculated sizes of cortical projections of the test gratings were made similar at different locations. Our results indicate that peripheral contrast sensitivity and acuity are inferior to foveal performance, because of the diminished cortical projection area.", "references": []},

Eric L. Grimson"], "date": "1981", "abstract": "Recently, Marr & Poggio (1979) presented a theory of human stereo vision. An implementation of that theory is presented, and consists of five steps. (i) The left and right images are each filtered with masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the shape of these masks is given by delta 2G, the Laplacian of a Gaussian function. (ii) Zero crossings in the filtered images are found along horizontal scan lines. (iii) For each mask size, matching takes place between zero crossings of the same sign and roughly the same orientation in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region. Within this disparity range, it can be shown that false targets pose only a simple problem. (iv) The output of the wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. In this way, the matching process gradually moves from dealing with large disparities at a low resolution to dealing with small disparities at a high resolution. (v) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2-dimensional sketch. To support the adequacy of the Marr-Poggio model of human stereo vision, the implementation was tested on a wide range of stereograms from the human stereopsis literature. The performance of the implementation is illustrated and compared with human perception. Also statistical assumptions made by Marr & Poggio are supported by comparison with statistics found in practice. Finally, the process of implementing the theory has led to the clarification and refinement of a number of details within the theory; these are discussed in detail.", "references": ["Vision-and-resolution-in-the-central-retina.-O'brien/3dad2cb7138817c2f5f377269bedae396ffe0018", "Smallest-channel-in-early-human-vision.-Marr-Poggio/eb351ebb9bc88f0af622f576ca19ea7cb841d958", "Theory-of-edge-detection.-Marr-Hildreth/f62fbec04ed3a4625a1bc4e83e6766e9b74673cc", "A-computational-theory-of-human-stereo-vision.-Marr-Poggio/fafd813987f868fbbd904520a68607166c66ea85", "A-four-mechanism-model-for-threshold-spatial-vision-Wilson-Bergen/b45c9da1e49cce9f37976d9187f85fb217d8d092", "Texture-contours-can-facilitate-stereopsis-by-eye-Kidd-Frisby/5680fe48e94d5de3cadadb1b164e1f4eab87739e", "Representation-and-recognition-of-the-spatial-of-Marr-Nishihara/bdf9b8f4de001f5f37bc844efbce1210d581d599", "Stereopsis-masking-in-humans-is-not-orientationally-Mayhew-Frisby/610f31e1fa57a0f8768a239acaa06d02758458ee"]},

These so called \u2019finite W algebras\u2019 are constructed as Poisson reductions of Kirillov Poisson structures on simple Lie algebras. The inequivalent reductions are labeled by the inequivalent embeddings of sl2 into the simple Lie algebra in question. For arbitrary embeddings a coordinate free formula for the reduced Poisson structure is derived. We also prove that any finite W algebra can be embedded into the Kirillov Poisson algebra of a (semi)simple Lie algebra (generalized Miura map). Furthermore it is shown that generalized finite Toda systems are reductions of a system describing a free particle moving on a group manifold and that they have finite W symmetry. In the second part we BRST quantize the finite W algebras. The BRST cohomology is calculated using a spectral sequence (which is different from the one used by Feigin and Frenkel). This allows us to quantize all finite W algebras in one stroke. Explicit results for sl3 and sl4 are given. In the last part of the paper we study the representation theory of finite W algebras. It is shown, using a quantum version of the generalized Miura transformation, that the representations of finite W algebras can be constructed from the representations of a certain Lie subalgebra of the original simple Lie algebra. As a byproduct of this we are able to construct the Fock realizations of arbitrary finite W algebras. e-mail: deboer@ruunts.fys.ruu.nl e-mail: tjin@phys.uva.nl", "references": ["Covariant-W-Gravity-%26-its-Moduli-Space-from-Gauge-Boer-Goeree/2a495d0bbb06e8342b4bb3db45dba7b34ac613e5"]},

The extensions will include sampling for functions of more than one variable, random processes, nonuniform sampling, nonband-limited functions, implicit sampling, generalized functions (distributions), sampling with the function and its derivatives as suggested by Shannon in his original paper, and sampling for general integral transforms. Also the conditions on the functions to be sampled will be summarized. The error analysis of the various sampling expansions, including specific error bounds for the truncation, aliasing, jitter and parts of various other errors will be discussed and summarized.

Summation over the receptive fields of some cells (X-cells) was found to be approximately linear, while for other cells (Y-cells) summation was very non-linear. 3. The mean discharge frequency of Y-cells (unlike that of X-cells) was greatly increased when grating patterns drifted across their receptive fields. 4. In twenty-one X-cells the relation between the contrast and spatial frequency of drifting sinusoidal gratings which evoked the same small response was measured. In every case it was found that the reciprocal of this relation, the contrast sensitivity function, could be satisfactorily described by the difference of two Gaussian functions. 5. This finding supports the hypothesis that the sensitivities of the antagonistic centre and surround summating regions of ganglion cell receptive fields fall off as Gaussian functions of the distance from the field centre. 6. The way in which the sensitivity of an X-cell for a contrast-edge pattern varied with the distance of the edge from the receptive field centre was determined and found to be consistent with the cell's measured contrast sensitivity function. 7.

Three strategies were used to isolate the threshold response of the channel: (1) The channel at 3.0 c/deg was chosen because of its position at the peak of the contrast sensitivity function. (2) A discrimination paradigm was used in which test stimuli were superimposed on a low contrast grating which was shown to selectively facilitate their detection. (3) The detecting channel was more sensitive to the sine-wave cot&guration of the test stimuIi than to more conventional spatial summation stimuli such as rectangular bnrs. Resutts of the main experiment showed that threshold contrasts for the truncated sine-wave stimuli declined in two stages. From 2.3\u2019 to 40\u2019. the threshold decline was steep, with a plateau at 10\u2019. From 40\u2019 to 4.6\u201d, threshold declined as a power function of stimulus width with an exponent of -0.35. The data of the main experiment were used to derive the spatial receptive field sensitivity for the channel at 3.Oc/deg.

Mathematicians such as Agranovic, Gelfand and Seeley had already attacked the basic problem from an analytic viewpoint, and various beguiling special cases, such as Hirzebruch\u2019s signature formula, were already known. But it was the insight of Atiyah and Singer to use K-theory to formulate and solve this problem. Another of their principal discoveries was the use of spinors and the existence of the Dirac operator in a general Riemannian context. Atiyah [At] has given an excellent account of his role in the development of the subject. The index theorem itself equates an analytic quantity, the index of an elliptic operator P on a compact manifold M , with certain characteristic numbers of M . More precisely, P : C\u221e(M ;E)\u2192 C\u221e(M ;F ) is a differential (or pseudodifferential) operator carrying smooth sections of a bundle E over M to smooth sections of another bundle F . For every point of the cotangent bundle (x, \u03be) \u2208 T \u2217M the principal symbol of P , \u03c3(P )(x, \u03be), is a homomorphism carrying Ex, the fibre of E at x, to Fx. When P is differential, the symbol may be defined in local coordinates by formally replacing each derivative \u2202/\u2202xj by 1 i \u03bej to obtain a polynomial in \u03be (with coefficients depending on x) of order m, the order of P ; the principal symbol is obtained by dropping all terms of homogeneity less than m. P is said to be elliptic when this homomorphism is invertible for all x \u2208 M and 0 6= \u03be \u2208 T \u2217 x (M). In particular, if P is elliptic, the rank of the bundles E and F is the same.

This observation dates back to at least the very early part of the last century when it was shown that the equations of massless particles on curved space-time exhibit conformal invariance. In this setting a key operator is the conformally invariant wave operator which has leading term a pseudo-Laplacian. The Riemannian signature variant of this operator is a fundamental tool in the Yamabe problem on compact manifolds. Here one seeks to find a metric, from a given conformal class, that has constant scalar curvature. Recently it has become clear that higher order analogues of these operators, viz., conformally invariant operators on weighted functions (i.e., conformal densities) with leading term a power of the Laplacian, have a central role in generating and solving other curvature prescription problems as well as other problems in geometric spectral theory and mathematical physics [2, 5, 15]. In the flat setting, the existence of such operators dates back to [16], where it is shown that, on 4-dimensional Minkowski space, for k \u2208 N = {1, 2, . . .}, the k power of the flat wave operator \u2206, acting on densities of the appropriate weight, is invariant under the action of the conformal group.

As a consequence, it is shown that bundles with closed connection form are stable under appropriate small perturbations of the symplectic form. Further, the manifold (M, \u03c9) has the property that every symplectic M -bundle has a closed connection form if and only if the flux group vanishes and the flux homomorphism extends to a crossed homomorphism defined on the whole group Symp(M).

MacQueen"], "date": "1967", "abstract": "The main purpose of this paper is to describe a process for partitioning an N-dimensional population into k sets on the basis of a sample. The process, which is called 'k-means,' appears to give partitions which are reasonably efficient in the sense of within-class variance. That is, if p is the probability mass function for the population, S = {S1, S2, * *, Sk} is a partition of EN, and ui, i = 1, 2, * , k, is the conditional mean of p over the set Si, then W2(S) = ff=ISi f z u42 dp(z) tends to be low for the partitions S generated by the method. We say 'tends to be low,' primarily because of intuitive considerations, corroborated to some extent by mathematical analysis and practical computational experience. Also, the k-means procedure is easily programmed and is computationally economical, so that it is feasible to process very large samples on a digital computer. Possible applications include methods for similarity grouping, nonlinear prediction, approximating multivariate distributions, and nonparametric tests for independence among several variables. In addition to suggesting practical classification methods, the study of k-means has proved to be theoretically interesting. The k-means concept represents a generalization of the ordinary sample mean, and one is naturally led to study the pertinent asymptotic behavior, the object being to establish some sort of law of large numbers for the k-means. This problem is sufficiently interesting, in fact, for us to devote a good portion of this paper to it. The k-means are defined in section 2.1, and the main results which have been obtained on the asymptotic behavior are given there. The rest of section 2 is devoted to the proofs of these results. Section 3 describes several specific possible applications, and reports some preliminary results from computer experiments conducted to explore the possibilities inherent in the k-means idea.

Tractor bundles and normal tractor connections Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian geometries are equipped with a canonical metric and the metric (or Levi-Civita) connection that it determines. For this reason, in the setting of these geometries, it is natural to calculate directly with the tangent bundle, its dual and the tensor bundles. On the other hand for many other interesting structures such as conformal geometries, CR geometries, projective geometries and quaternionic structures the situation is not so fortunate. These structures are among the broad class of so-called parabolic geometries and for the geometries within this class there is no canonical connection or metric on the tangent bundle or the tensor bundles. Nevertheless for these structures there is a class of natural vector bundles which do have a canonical connection. These are the tractor bundles and the calculus based around these bundles is a natural analog of the tensor bundle and Levi-Civita connection calculus of Riemannian geometry. 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. \u2014 primary: 53B15, 53C05, 53C07, 53C15 secondary: 53A20, 53A30, 53A40, 53A55.", "references": ["On-Conformal-Geometry.-Thomas/057e7a4ca5a6b930ffff0fc0210efcac2e23c879", "Invariant-Operators-on-Manifolds-with-Almost-%2C-III-Cap-Slovak/5d31dbaff08d558a65c9690afa0718f45d160583"]},

Zworski"], "date": "1999", "abstract": "R esonances are most readily associated with musical instruments or with the Tacoma bridge disaster. The latter is described in many physics and ODE books, and at the Ontario Science Center one can even find a model allowing one to find the destructive resonant frequency. The resonances I would like to write about are closely related but have their origins in quantum or electromagnetic scattering. To introduce them in a rough way, let us first recall the notion of eigenvalues. Eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators describe, among other things, the energies of bound states, states that exist forever if unperturbed. These do exist in real life; for instance, we can tell the composition of stars from our knowledge of atomic spectra. In most situations, however, states do not exist forever, and a more accurate model is given by a decaying state that oscillates at some rate. The decay might be caused by damping or by a possibility of escape to infinity. To describe these more realistic states, we use resonances. They have a very long tradition in mathematical physics, but they also appear naturally in pure mathematics. The last ten years brought many new ideas and new results into the subject. Old problems concerning the proximity of resonances to the real axis, their relation to quasi-modes, and their distribution for scattering by convex bodies have been solved. Upper bounds for counting functions of resonances have become well understood, and the new area of lower bounds has become active. New directions were opened by considering resonances in geometry, where in fact they make a very natural appearance. The purpose of this article is to motivate the study of resonances and to survey the recent advances. The focus of the presentation is very personal, and many aspects of the enormous subject of resonances are bound to be neglected. Allusion to some other aspects of the subject is made at various places in the text, and some references, or pointers to lists of references, are included.", "references": ["Geometric-Scattering-Theory-(Richard-B.-Melrose)-Sylvester/4b3925dcc6349eb2f1f686b282c75f8cc2518f45"]},

Melrose)", "authors": ["John Sylvester"], "date": "1996", "abstract": "topic which led to the discovery of solitons. The discussion is clear and informative, and should be found useful by the student. The remaining five chapters of the book deal with real fluids, although some of them are rather exotic. Chapter 6 introduces the stress and rate of strain tensors and derives the fundamental Navier-Stokes equations for a Newtonian fluid, in which stress and rate of strain are linearly related. Simple unidirectional or cylindrical, steady or unsteady, exact solutions are obtained and there are applications to lubrication theory, Hele-Shaw flow, and geophysical fluid dynamics. Creeping flow past a sphere is considered and application is made to the Einstein formula for the viscosity of a suspension of solid spheres. This is heady stuff for an introductory text, but a good student will appreciate the challenge. Chapter 7 introduces one of the most basic ideas of modern fluid dynamics, the Prandtl boundary layer, which changed theoretical fluid dynamics from a game for the mathematician to a real physical science. Here there is some divergence from the author\u2019s intention to stop short of unexciting technical detail, and the chapter is a hodge-podge of miscellaneous items concerned with flow past bluff bodies and aerofoils. The discussion is vague and uncertain, because this is in fact one of the areas of fluid mechanics where open questions and incomplete theories abound. Modern boundary layer theory, with its emphasis on the \"triple deck,\" would have been completely out of place here, but perhaps the student should at least have been made aware of its existence and relevance to boundary layer separation and other phenomena. Chapter 8 is devoted to the topic of hydrodynamic instability. The classical instabilities are introduced and described, keeping the mathematics as simple as possible. The reviewer thinks, however, that the omission of the OrrSommerfeld equation, which has played such a fundamental role in the study of instability in the present century, is a serious gap. Also, the recently discovered secondary instabilities and bifurcations should be of interest to the student. In Chapter 9, the nettle of turbulence (perhaps the last great unsolved problem of classical physics) is grasped. The author deserves praise for his bravery. Turbulence is a rock on which many sophisticated physical theories (one could almost say careers) have foundered. It is gratifying that the student will find here an excellent description of the various problems and reasonably successful attempts at simple theoretical understanding. The reviewer knows of nothing better for a first read. Finally, Chapter 10 discusses non-Newtonian behavior of fluids, where there is not a linear relation between stress and rate of strain, and memory or hysteretic effects may be present. Here the qualitative description is more concerned with the microscopic structure ofthe fluids that give rise to the non-Newtonian behavior than to the fluid dynamics of the liquids, and the chapter does stick out like a sore thumb when compared with the rest of the book. The professional fluid dynamicist welcomes the interest shown by physicists in his or her field and is delighted to see physicists providing texts for their students to learn about the field. Faber has provided a book which gives a broad overview and studies quantitative properties using relatively simple mathematics. He has successfully attained his goal, and students graduating into the more advanced topics will have found that his book provided a valuable introduction to basic concepts. There are some arguable points in his treatment and selection of material, but the good far outweighs the controversial. Perhaps the most serious complaint that can be made is the absence of exercises. It is not easy in fluid dynamics to come up with questions that are of physical relevance and can be done with elementary mathematics, but a few exercises for the student would probably have been helpful.", "references": []},

Cheeger and D. Gromoll [CG72], a complete open manifold of nonnegative sectional curvature is diffeomorphic to the total space of the normal bundle of a compact totally geodesic submanifold, called the soul. A natural problem is to what extent the converse to the soul theorem holds. In other words, one asks which vector bundles admit complete nonnegatively curved metrics. Various aspects of this problem have been studied in [Che73, Rig78, \u00d6W94, Yan95, GZ00, BK01b]. In this paper we only deal with bundles over closed manifolds diffeomorphic to C \u00d7 T , where C is simply-connected and T is a standard torus. By [CG72] any soul has a finite cover of this form, where sec(C) \u2265 0. Until recently, obstructions to the existence of metrics with sec \u2265 0 on vector bundles were only known for flat souls [\u00d6W94], which corresponds to the case when C is a point. In [BK01b] we produced a variety of examples of vector bundles which do not admit complete metrics with sec \u2265 0. For instance, we showed that for any C and T with dim(T ) \u2265 4 and k \u2265 2, there are infinitely many rank k vector bundles over C\u00d7T whose total spaces admit no complete metrics with sec \u2265 0. In all these examples dim(T ) > 0, in fact no obstructions are known to the existence of complete metrics with sec \u2265 0 on vector bundles over simply-connected nonnegatively curved manifolds. We first explain our approach to finding obstructions in case dim(T ) > 0. The main geometric ingredient is the splitting theorem in [Wil00, BK01b], which says that after passing to a finite cover, the normal bundle to the soul can be taken, by a base-preserving diffeomorphism, to the product \u03beC \u00d7 T of a vector bundle \u03beC over C with the torus T (see Theorem 3.1). Then one is faced with the purely topological problem of recognizing whether a given vector bundle over C \u00d7 T has this property. In other words, one needs to study the orbit of \u03beC \u00d7 T under the action of the diffeomorphism group of C \u00d7 T . Since vector bundles are rationally classified by the Euler and Pontrjagin classes, the problem reduces to analyzing the action of Diffeo(C\u00d7T ) on the rational cohomology algebra H\u2217(C\u00d7T,Q) of C\u00d7T . The \u201cTaylor expansion\u201d in T -coordinates of any self-diffeomorphism of C\u00d7T gives rise to a negative degree derivation of H\u2217(C,Q). One of the main points of this paper is that the orbit of \u03beC \u00d7 T consists of bundles of the same form, unless there exists a negative degree derivation of H\u2217(C,Q) that does not vanish on the Euler or", "references": ["Finiteness-theorems-for-nonnegatively-curved-vector-Belegradek-Kapovitch/40f86ba0bac17b65772ddc2430e89334031e6fc1", "Curvature-and-symmetry-of-Milnor-spheres-Ziller/1d0b40498c164600eec60300df01a9efb5578de0", "The-Metric-Projection-onto-the-Soul-Guijarro/c01462d86faff50e4c744c098f309a1de7a602c0"]},

There are many different versions of this construction. Here I will in the main follow Liu\u2013Tian [LiuT1,2] since their approach (when modified by an idea of Seibert\u2019s) seems to involve the least amount of analysis. However, it does involve quite a bit of topology, some of which they only outline. The aim here is to flesh out their picture and to explain the different ingredients that are needed to make the construction work. We do not try to give full proofs, nor do we work out all the ideas in full generality. Liu\u2013Tian work in the category of partially smooth spaces (spaces with two topologies), and represent the virtual moduli cycle by the zero set of a suitable multi-section of a multi-bundle. We show explicitly how to assemble this zero set into an object that we call a branched labelled pseudomanifold. Our theory is quite general, and suggests that every finite dimensional orbifold has a \u201cresolution\u201d of this form. An example is worked out in \u00a74.4.

It gives a proof that the rational cohomology splits additively as the vector space tensor product H * (M)\u2297 H * (S 2), and investigates conditions under which the ring structure also splits, thus generalizing work of Lalonde\u2013McDuff\u2013Polterovich and Seidel. The main tool is a study of certain operations in the quantum homology of the total space P and of the fiber M , whose properties reflect the relations between the Gromov\u2013Witten invariants of P and M. In order to establish these properties we further develop the language introduced in [Mc3] to describe the virtual moduli cycle (defined A fibration P \u2192 B is called symplectic if its fiber is a symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9) and its structural group is the group of symplectomorphisms Symp(M, \u03c9). Thus each fiber M b = p \u22121 (b) is equipped with a well-defined symplectic form \u03c9 b. To say that p is Hamilto-nian means that the structural group reduces further to the group of Hamiltonian symplec-tomorphisms Ham(M, \u03c9). As noted by Seidel [Sd1], when B = S 2 this is equivalent to the existence of a symplectic form \u2126 on P that restricts to \u03c9 b on each fiber. Moreover, we can choose \u2126 to be compatible with the orientation of P defined by the standard orientations on S 2 and on (M, \u03c9). Such forms \u2126 are said to be compatible with p. It is easy to see that the set of all such forms is path connected. This means in particular that the Gromov\u2013Witten invariants of P do not depend on the choice of \u2126. We shall say that the rational cohomology H * (P) = H * (P, Q) of P is additively split if it is isomorphic (as a vector space) to the tensor product H * (M) \u2297 H * (B). This happens if and only if the rational homology H * (M) of M injects into that of P.

These orbits and their covers generalize the oscillator phase space T R, which occurs here when GR = Sp(2n,R) and OR is minimal. A complex structure J polarizing OR and invariant under a maximal compact subgroup KR ofGR is provided by the Kronheimer-Vergne Kaehler structure (J, \u03c9).

Since the aim of this paper is to present explicit links between the development in CSS1, CSS2, CSS3, CSS4] to other approaches established in the literature mostly for the special case of the conformal structures, we have rst to review the main concepts and results.

The AHS structures The study of the conformal and projective structures on manifolds has a long history and the techniques leading to tensorial invariants and invariantly deened diierential operators belonged always to the main aims. These two particular structures were known to allow a common development of the basic theory in the terms of the so called j1j-graded Lie algebras, see e.g. Kob]. A general discussion on geometries associated to such Lie algebras was worked out in Och].

In arbitrary codimensions, small metric balls around a soul turn out to be convex, so that the unit normal bundle of S also admits a metric of nonnegative curvature. Next we examine how the horizontal curvatures at infinity determine the geometry of M , and study the structure of Sharafutdinov lines. We conclude with regularity properties of the cut and conjugate loci of M . The resolution of the Soul conjecture of Cheeger and Gromoll by Perelman showed that the structure of open manifolds with nonnegative sectional curvature is more rigid than expected. One of the key results in [14] is that the metric projection \u03c0 : M \u2192 S which maps a point p in M to the point \u03c0(p) in S that is closest to p is a Riemannian submersion. Perelman also observed that this map is at least of class C, and later it was shown in [9] that \u03c0 is at least C, and C\u221e at almost every point. The existence of such a Riemannian submersion combined with the restriction on the sign of the curvature suggests that the geometry of M must be special. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate this in several different directions. In fact, we show that most natural geometric objects classically used in the study of these spaces are intrinsically related to the structure of the map \u03c0. The paper is essentially structured as follows: After introducing notation and recalling some basic results in section 1, we establish in section 2 the existence of maps similar to \u03c0 for any submanifold of M homologous and isometric to the soul, and use this to prove the existence of convex tubular neighborhoods for them. In particular, this also proves: Theorem 2.5. The unit normal bundle \u03bd1(S) admits a metric with nonnegative sectional curvature. As a consequence, open manifolds with nonnegative curvature provide examples of compact manifolds with the same lower curvature bound (see also [8]). Theorem 2.5 also implies that nontrivial plane bundles over a Bieberbach manifold do not admit nonnegatively curved metrics, thereby providing a shorter proof of the main result in [13]. We are grateful to the referee for pointing out this fact to us. Properties such as these are established via standard submersion techniques, but the fact that \u03c0 is not known to be smooth everywhere prevents us from using these techniques to study the geometry of M far away from the soul.

Working in the compact realization we nd the eigenvalues of the operators on the K-types, and give several examples. Among the advantages of our method is its applicability to bundle-valued cases. 0. Introduction Intertwining operators of various forms play an important role in the theory of representations of semisimple Lie groups. This is in particular the case for principal series representations, where intertwinors have been applied to classiication and unitarity questions. In the Knapp-Stein theory, one starts with a non-compact realization of the principal series in which the intertwinors appear as singular integral operators depending on a parameter. Analytic continuation in the parameter is then performed in a compact picture. On the other hand, all information is also encoded in the behavior of intertwinors on the K-isotypic submodules. In this work we present a new way of constructing intertwining operators between principal series representations induced from maximal parabolic subgroups P, in the case where K-types occur with multiplicity at most 1. The method amounts to setting up an apparatus which will calculate explicitly the spectra of the operators; i.e., the eigenvalues on each K-type. The search for these eigenvalues is by no means a new project (at least in the spherical, or line bundle case, in which one induces from a 1-dimensional representation). Notable progress along these lines, in the spherical case, was made by Johnson and Wallach for rank one groups, and more recently by Kostant and Sahi, in connection with the Capelli identity. In our approach, one is excused from some of the hard work; for example, that of computing radial parts of diierential operators. This would be a formidable undertaking in the bundle-valued case, and the fact that we can bypass some of this analysis is related to the relative utility of our apparatus in the bundle case. An important application of the results obtained from the spectrum generating technique is to the determination of composition series of principal series representations. This, of course, should be a consequence of any analysis of the intertwinors, together with some analysis of irreducibility questions for the subquotients obtained from the (rational) spectral function. We include a brief discussion of irreducibil-ity questions here, and present a method of deriving strong irreducibility results", "references": ["Sharp-Inequalities-%2C-the-Functional-Determinant-%2C-Branson/4e80a846eede8867be34d9b8fe46739cadaf0fa9"]},

This Erratum will not be published. The paper defines Ham(M,\u03c9) to be the group of Hamiltonian automorphisms, equipped with the C\u221e-topology, and G as \u201cthe group of smooth based loops in Ham(M,\u03c9)\u201d. This is a misleading formulation, since what the paper really means is that elements of G are Hamiltonian loops. If one understands it in that way, then the proof of [2, Lemma 2.1] as given is incorrect. However, the distinction between \u201csmooth loops in the symplectic automorphism group which remain inside Ham(M,\u03c9)\u201d and \u201cHamiltonian loops\u201d is ultimately irrelevant, because of the following: Lemma. Let (\u03c6t)0\u2264t\u22641 be a smooth isotopy of symplectic automorphisms of M , such that each \u03c6t is Hamiltonian. Then, the isotopy itself is a Hamiltonian isotopy. Proof. Let at \u2208 H(M ;R) be the infinitesimal flux of the isotopy. This depends smoothly on t. If at is nonzero at some point t \u2208 (0, 1), one can find arbitrarily small such that (1) \u222b t+ t\u2212 at dt 6= 0. By assumption, \u03c6t\u2212 and \u03c6t+ are both Hamiltonian. By connecting them to the identity, one forms a loop in the symplectic automorphism group whose flux is (1). But this flux can be made arbitrarily small, contradicting [1]. Hence, at is necessarily identically zero. After appealing to that, the proof of [2, Lemma 2.1] goes through as stated in the paper. References [1] K. Ono.

In particular, we solve the extremal problems for the functional determinants of the conformai Laplacian and of the square of the Dirac operator on S2 , and in the standard conformai classes on S4 and S6 .

INTRODUCTION Some very recent work in analysis and geometry has revealed strong new connections among fields which, while never completely separate, have at least been studied in very different ways. Part of the stimulus for this has been physical string theory, which led in the last decade to a fresh look at Riemann surfaces, always a meeting ground for different disciplines in analysis. In this paper, we would like to clarify some of these connections as they have manifested themselves in the study of string theoretic principles in higher ( > 2 ) dimensions. Broadly speaking, the fields in question are: (I) the spectral theory of differential operators; (II) conformai geometry; and Received by the editors June 30, 1992 and, in revised form, July 16, 1994. 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

In nonpositive (sectional) curvature and higher rank, all locally irreducible finite volume manifolds (with bounded curvature) are locally symmetric spaces [1], [8], [12]. This result uses the special properties of nonpositive curvature in an essential way. In fact, Heintze found examples of normally homogeneous nonsymmetric spaces of nonnegative curvature and higher rank [16]. In this note, we will obtain more examples of higher rank and nonnegarive curvature with some new features. Indeed, the whole point of this paper is to show that higher rank metrics in nonnegative curvature can be very complicated. One should compare our situation with the pinching theorems. There there is a duality between positive and negative curvature. In fact, if M is any rank 1 compact locally symmetric space with nonconstant curvature then any other 1/4-pinched metric on M must be symmetric. For positive curvature, this is a consequence of Berger's famous rigidity theorem [ I0]. For negative curvature, this was proved by Hamenstfidt [ 15]. Notice though that there really is no theorem dual to the sphere theorem in negative curvature, due to the Gromov-Thurs ton examples of compact manifolds with arbitrarily pinched sectional curvatures which are not homotopy equivalent to a space with constant curvature. Similarly, our examples show that duality fails for the higher-rank rigidity theorems.", "references": []},

In this article, a classification of hyperpolar actions on the irreducible Riemannian symmetric spaces of compact type is given. Since on these symmetric spaces actions of cohomogeneity one are hyperpolar, i.e. normal geodesics are closed, we obtain a classification of the homogeneous hypersurfaces in these spaces by computing the cohomogeneity for all hyperpolar actions. This result implies a classification of the cohomogeneity one actions on compact strongly isotropy irreducible homogeneous spaces. Introduction and Results An isometric action of a compact Lie group on a Riemannian manifold M is called polar if there exists a closed, connected submanifold \u03a3 of M that meets all orbits orthogonally. Such a submanifold is called a section; it is automatically totally geodesic in M . If the section is also flat, then the action is called hyperpolar. Typical examples of hyperpolar actions are the adjoint actions of compact Lie groups equipped with a bi-invariant metric, where the sections are the maximal tori, or, more generally, the isotropy actions of symmetric spaces. Other examples are the polar representations of compact Lie groups. They are also hyperpolar because the sections are linear subspaces. The irreducible polar representations were classified by [Dadok]. The main result of [Dadok] is that all polar representations are orbit equivalent (i.e. have the same orbits) to isotropy representations of symmetric spaces. The principal orbits of polar representations are isoparametric submanifolds of Sn\u22121 \u2282 R. More generally, the principal orbits of hyperpolar actions on symmetric spaces of the compact type are equifocal submanifolds [TT]. The main result of this article is the classification of hyperpolar actions on the irreducible Riemannian symmetric spaces of the compact type up to orbit equivalence. The problem of classifiying hyperpolar actions on symmetric spaces was posed in [HPTT1]. A classification and structure theory for hyperpolar actions with a fixed point on compact homogeneous Riemannian manifolds was developed in [HPTT2]. An important special case of independent interest is given by cohomogeneity one actions, i.e. actions whose principal orbits have codimension one.

Many important theorems in this field have been proved by this technique, among them, the squeezing theorem [Gr], the rigidity theorem [E], the classification of rational and ruled symplectic 4-manifolds [M2], the proof of the existence of non-deformation equivalent symplectic structures [R2]. The pseudo-holomorphic curve also plays a critical role in a number of new subjects such as Floer homology theory,etc. In the meantime of this development, a great deal of efforts has been made to solidify the foundation of pseudo-holomorphic curve theory, for examples, McDuff\u2019s transversality theorem for \u201ccusp curves\u201d [M1] and the various proofs of Gromov compactness theorem. In the early day of Gromov theory, Gromov compactness theorem was enough for its applications to symplectic topology. However, it was insufficient for its potential applications in algebraic geometry, where a good compactification is often very important. For example, it is particularly desirable to tie Gromov-compactness theorem to the DeligneMumford compactification of the moduli space of stable curves. Gromov\u2019s original proof is geometric. Afterwards, many works were done to prove Gromov compactness theorem in the line of Uhlenbeck bubbling off. It was succeed by Parker-Wolfson [PW] and Ye [Ye]. One outcome of their work was a more delicate compactification of the moduli space of pseudo-holomorphic maps. But it didn\u2019t attract much attention until several years later when Kontsevich and Manin [KM] rediscovered this new compactification in algebraic geometry and initiated an algebro-geometric approach to the same theory. Now this new compactification becomes known as the moduli space of stable maps. The moduli space of stable maps is one of the basic ingredients of this paper. During last several years, pseudo-holomorphic curve theory entered a period of rapid expansion. We has witnessed its intensive interactions with algebraic geometry, mathematical physics and recently with new Seiberg-Witten theory of 4-manifolds [T2]. One should mention that those recent activities in pseudo-holomorphic curve theory did not come from the internal drive of symplectic topology. It was influenced mostly by mathematical physics, particularly, Witten\u2019s theory of topological sigma model.

The construction of a complete action for chiral N = 2 (or IIB) supergravity in ten\u2013 dimensional space\u2013time [1] is a long standing problem, which has become topical again in connection with a \u201cduality revolution\u201d. Its solution has been hampered by the presence in the bosonic sector of the theory of a four\u2013form gauge field A(x) whose five\u2013form field strength M = dA + ... is self\u2013dual, i.e. M = M (where * denotes the Hodge conjugation of the differential forms). This field comes from the Ramond\u2013Ramond (RR) sector of IIB superstring theory. The problem is to find a D = 10 covariant action from which the self\u2013duality condition would follow as an A field equation of motion. An action proposed for IIB supergravity in [2] is based on a modification of the Siegel approach [3] to a space\u2013time covariant Lagrangian description of self\u2013dual fields. An kurt.lechner@pd.infn.it dsorokin@kipt.kharkov.ua unsatisfactory feature of this construction is that Lagrange multiplier fields which are used to get the self\u2013duality condition cannot be completely eliminated by local symmetries and equations of motion of the model, and the treatment of remaining auxiliary degrees of freedom is not clear. Another possibility of solving the problem of the self\u2013dual field is to use a covariant McClain\u2013Wu\u2013Yu approach which involves infinite number of auxiliary fields [4, 5, 6]. An interesting observation concerning this construction is that it arises as an effective action of a closed superstring field theory [5]. Because of an infinite series of fields one may encounter technical complications when generalizing such a model to a locally supersymmetric case. In this note we propose a D = 10 covariant action for the bosonic sector of IIB supergravity, where to get manifest space\u2013time covariance of the self\u2013dual field part of the action only one scalar auxiliary field is used. Such a covariant approach to deal with self\u2013dual fields was proposed in [8, 9] and has been applied to the duality\u2013symmetric description of (super)Maxwell theory [8] coupled to electric and magnetic sources [10], and to the SL(2, R) \u00d7 SO(6, 22) invariant effective field theory action in D = 4 of a toroidally compactified heterotic string [8]. This approach has proved to be pretty helpful in constructing a complete action for the M\u2013theory 5\u2013brane propagating in a D = 11 supergravity background [11] and considering its K3 compactification [12]. A relationship between the single scalar field approach and the McClain\u2013Wu\u2013Yu approach has been established in [9], which allows one to straightforwardly get a IIB supergravity action in the latter formulation. We present this action in the conclusion of the article. The covariant action for the bosonic sector of D = 10 IIB supergravity which one gets with the use of a single scalar auxiliary field has the following form S = \u222b dx \u221a \u2212g[R \u2212 2\u2202m\u03c6\u2202\u03c6 \u2212 2e\u2202m\u03c6\u2202\u03c6 \u2212 1 3 eHlmnH lmn \u2212 1 3 (H \u2032 lmn \u2212 \u03c6Hlmn)(H \u2032 lmn \u2212 \u03c6H )] (1) \u2212 6 \u222b dx \u221a\u2212g \u2202ra\u2202a \u2202a(x)M lm1...m4M \u2202pa(x) \u2212 4 \u222b A \u2227 H \u2227 H , where gmn(x) (m,n=0,...,9) is a D = 10 space\u2013time metric, R(x) is a D = 10 scalar curvature, \u03c6(x) and \u03c6(x) are, respectively, the Neveu\u2013Schwarz (NS) dilaton and the RR scalar; H = dB and H \u2032 = dB are the three\u2013form field strengths of, respectively, the NS two\u2013form gauge field B(x) and the RR two\u2013from gauge field B(x), M = dA + 1 2 B \u2227 H \u2032 \u2212 1 2 B \u2227 H (2) Note, however, that in [7] it has been shown how to construct in this approach superfield actions for D = 4 supersymmetric Maxwell theory with manifest dualities.", "references": ["Wrapping-the-M-Theory-Five-Brane-on-K-3-Cherkis-Schwarz/9926404a9fd12b349b06d6f19f43d12eb43f01a6", "Four-Lectures-on-M-theory-A-Townsend/1aac91b14f5ca9c6d1c8acea1643a356a66c3912"]},

More refined invariants, now known under the name of GromovWitten (GW) invariants, turned up somewhat later in physics as correlation functions in Witten\u2019s topological sigma models ([Wi1], [Wi2], [Va]), and were put on a solid mathematical basis by Ruan and Tian using a construction reminiscent of Donaldson theory [Ru], [RuTi1], [McSa], [RuTi2]. The mathematical theory is based on transversality and genericity arguments with the purpose of identifying certain moduli spaces of pseudo holomorphic curves as manifolds, supplemented by the Gromov compactness theorem and a dimension estimate on the \u201cbad part\u201d at infinity. One of the great shortcomings of this method is that the dimension count forces strong positivity conditions on the symplectic manifolds to be considered, while from the expected formal properties of the invariants (axiomatized in [KoMa]) nothing hints on such limitations of GW-theory. The restriction is the more annoying as it not only bounds the range of applicability; but it also hinders the whole development of the theory for most natural operations on symplectic manifolds do not stay inside the class of positive manifolds. Deeper support in favour of general validity of GW-theory come from the development of the analogous invariants in algebraic geometry, that has been achieved recently by Li and Tian [LiTi], and (loosely based on their ideas) in a more systematic way in two fine papers of Behrend and Behrend/Fantechi [Be], [BeFa]. Ultimately it would be desirable to have a similarly general theory in the symplectic category, together with a comparison theorem linking to the algebraic theory, which would then combine the computational power and the strength of handling singular situations from algebraic geometry with the full symplectic topological significance and range of applications of the invariants.

Arnold's conjecture. An automorphism ^ of a symplectic manifold (P,u;) is homologous to the identity if there is a smooth family tyt (* \u20ac [0,1]) of automorphisms such that the time-dependent vector field \u00a3t defined by di^t/dt = & \u00b0 ^t is globally hamiltonian; i.e. if there is a smooth family Ht of real-valued functions on P such that \u00a3*JC\u00dc = dHt. It was conjectured by Arnold [1], as an extension of the Poincar\u00e9-Birkhoff annulus theorem [3, 7], that every automorphism of a compact symplectic manifold P, homologous to the identity, has at least as many fixed points as a function on P has critical points. Arnold's conjecture was proven by Conley and Zehnder [4] for the torus T \u00ab R 2 n / Z 2 n with its usual symplectic structure. They show that every symplectic automorphism of T 2 n , homologous to the identity, has at least n + 1 fixed points, and at least 2 n if all are nondegenerate. Their method was extended in [8] to prove a version of Arnold's conjecture for arbitrary P under the additional assumption that the hamiltonian vector field \u00a3t is sufficiently C\u00b0 small. In this note we announce a proof of Arnold's conjecture for the complex projective space C P n with its standard symplectic structure. We prove that a symplectic diffeomorphism of C P n , homologous to the identity, has at least n+\\ distinct fixed points. (By the Lefschetz fixed point theorem, any continuous map from C P n to itself, homotopic to the identity, has at least n + 1 fixed points counted with multiplicities.) For n = 1 (CP 1 \u00ab S) the result was already known [1], but with a proof which worked only in this two-dimensional case. The proof for T 2 n in [4] made use of a variational principle in which the fixed points of the map were identified with periodic solutions of a timedependent hamiltonian system and then identified with critical points of a functional on the space of contractible loops on T n . The corresponding functional in the case of C P n is multiple valued, and there are other difficulties connected with the curved geometry of C P n , so we need a new approach. Our trick is to consider the hamiltonian system on C P n as the reduction, in the sense of [6], of a hamiltonian system on C n + 1 and then adapt recently developed methods [2] for finding periodic orbits in C n + 1 . This method is similar to that of Conley and Zehnder in that a problem on a compact manifold is lifted to a problem on euclidean space invariant under a group of transformations.", "references": []},

The non-critical string theory is related to critical string theory in anti-deSitter background. We introduce a boundary of the anti-deSitter space analogous to a cut-off on the Liouville coordinate of the two-dimensional string theory. Correlation functions of operators in the gauge theory are related to the dependence of the supergravity action on the boundary conditions. From the quadratic terms in supergravity we read off the anomalous dimensions. For operators that couple to massless string states it has been established through absorption calculations that the anomalous dimensions vanish, and we rederive this result. The operators that couple to massive string states at level n acquire anomalous dimensions that grow as 2 ( ngY M \u221a 2N 1/2 for large \u2018t Hooft coupling.

Such a \u2211 is called a section. A section is automatically totally geodesic in M , and if it is also flat in the induced metric then the action is called hyperpolar . In this paper we study hyperpolar actions on compact symmetric spaces, prove some structure and classification theorems for them, and study their relation to polar actions on Hilbert space and to involutions of affine Kac-Moody algebras. The origin of the theory of hyperpolar actions can be traced back at least to the 1950\u2019s, with Bott [B] and Bott and Samelson\u2019s [BS] introduction of the closely related concept of a \u201cvariationally complete\u201d action. We will give a brief review below of what we know of the history of this subject, but first we recall some basic notation and terminology from the theory of symmetric spaces that will be needed throughout the paper. Let G be a compact, semi-simple, connected Lie group, and G = TGe its Lie algebra. A subgroup K of G is called a symmetric subgroup of G (and the pair (G, K) is called a symmetric pair) if there is an involution \u03c3 of G such that (K\u03c3)0 \u2282 K \u2282 K\u03c3, where K\u03c3 is the fixed point set of \u03c3 and (K\u03c3)0 is the connected component of K\u03c3. In this case G/K equipped with a G-invariant metric induced from any AdG invariant inner product for G is a symmetric space. The corresponding orthogonal decomposition G = K \u2295 P is called the Cartan decomposition associated to \u03c3. It is completely determined by \u03c3 (independent of the inner product on G); namely K and P are respectively the +1 and \u22121 eigenspaces of d\u03c3e : G \u2192 G. It follows that K and P satisfy the characteristic bracket relations [K,K] \u2286 K, [K,P] \u2286 P , and [P,P] \u2286 K.", "references": ["A-Bruhat-decomposition-for-the-loop-space-of-a-A-to-Garland-Raghunathan/c727eaab22e0a8ab2c8d0dd4337cc1f4d2a60664"]},

It possesses a fermionic BRST-like symmetry, conserved for arbitrary \u03a3, and obeying Q = 0. In a suitable version, the quantum ground states are the 1 + 1 dimensional Floer groups. The correlation functions of the BRST-invariant operators are invariants (depending only on the homotopy type of the almost complex structure of M) similar to those that have entered in recent work of Gromov on symplectic geometry. The model can be coupled to dynamical gravitational or gauge fields while preserving the fermionic symmetry; some observations by Atiyah suggest that the latter coupling may be related to the Jones polynomial of knot theory.

Methods of quantum field theory recently led to a prediction of some numerical characteristics of the space of algebraic curves in V , especially of genus zero, eventually endowed with a parametrization and marked points. It turned out that an appropriate generating function \u03a6 whose coefficients are these numbers has a physical meaning (\" potential \" , or \" free energy \"), and its analytical properties can be guessed with such a precision that it becomes uniquely defined. In particular, when V is a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold, \u03a6 conjecturally describes a variation of Hodge structure of the mirror dual manifold in special coordinates (see contributions in [Y], [Ko], [Ma2]) which identifies \u03a6 as a specific combination of hypergeometric functions. In this paper, we use a different tool, the so called \" associativity \" relations, or WDVV\u2013equations (see [W], [D]), in order to show that for Fano manifolds these equations tend to be so strong that they can define \u03a6 uniquely up to a choice of a finite number of constants. (For Calabi\u2013Yau varieties these equations hold as well, but they do not constraint \u03a6 to such extent). Mathematically, this formalism is based upon the theory of the Gromov\u2013Witten classes. In our setup, they form a collection of linear maps I that ought to be defined for all integers g \u2265 0, n + 2g \u2212 3 \u2265 0, and homology classes \u03b2 \u2208 H 2 (V, Z) and are expected to satisfy a series of formal properties as well as geometric ones. (Here M g,n is the coarse moduli space of stable curves of genus g with n marked points). In \u00a72 of this paper, we compile a list of these formal properties, or \" axioms \" (see subsections 2.2.0\u20132.2.8), and explain the geometric intuition behind them (2.3.0\u2013 2.3.8).

One example is Donaldson theory (and more recently the Seiberg-Witten invariants), which provides a set of differential invariants of 4-manifolds [Do]. When the underlying manifolds are smooth algebraic surfaces, then they are the intersection theories on the moduli spaces of vector bundles over these surfaces [Li], [Mo]. Another example is the mathematical theory, inspired by the sigma model theory in mathematical physics ([W1], [W2]), of quantum cohomology. The quantum cohomology uses the GW-invariants, which are the intersection numbers of certain induced homology classes on the moduli spaces of rational curves in a given symplectic manifold. This is a generalization of the classical enumerative invariant which counts the number of algebraic curves with appropriate constraints in a variety. The first mathematical foundation of quantum cohomology was established by Ruan and the second named author in [RT1] for semi-positive symplectic manifolds, which include all algebraic manifolds of complex dimension less than 4, all Fano manifolds and Calabi-Yau spaces. In [RT2], general GW-invariants of higher genus are constructed to establish a mathematical theory of the sigma model theory coupled with gravity on any semi-positive symplectic manifolds (also see [Ru] for the special cases). There are some related works we would like to mention. In [KM], Kontsevich and Manin proposed an axiomatic approach to GW-invariants, and in [Ko2], Kontsevich introduced the notion of stable maps to study GW-invariants. There are also works dealing with special classes of Fano varieties, such as homogeneous manifolds (cf. [BDW], [Ber], [Ci], [CM], [LT]). Now let us discuss the new issue in intersection theory raised from studying GW-invariants, and more generally the Donaldson type invariants. The core of an intersection theory is the fundamental class. For a manifold (or a variety), the ordinary cup product with the fundamental class given by the underlying manifold provides a satisfactory intersection theory. However, for the GW-invariants, which should be an intersection theory on the moduli space of stable maps, we cannot take the fundamental class of the whole moduli space directly. This is because the relative moduli space (i.e., the family version) in general does not form a flat", "references": ["Quantum-Schubert-Calculus-Bertram/e159b6f2cfc768593a8450c1a98796d44be80c0f", "The-Intrinsic-Normal-Cone-Fantechi/11957d706d0a893c2e77fb06ace80ff3b136e172", "The-Product-Formula-for-Gromov-witten-Invariants-Behrend/9dfa4c8f944213e6f53baef81f446a89529e4033", "Gromov-Witten-invariants-for-general-symplectic-Siebert/1795bc6341f04256493928ef4a60d77178f532af", "Virtual-moduli-cycles-and-Gromov-Witten-invariants-Li/5746c42145a07d9cdc41f29703e44480dcbcfd21", "Enumeration-of-Rational-Curves-via-Torus-Actions-Kontsevich/289d98c7dd2da5d818d7cb813434bd1b06557f8e"]},

Recall from [ibid.] that virtual fundamental classes are constructed using an obstruction theory, and the intrinsic normal cone.

Using a web of duality symmetries one can connect all known string theories and eleven dimensional supergravity, leading to a conjectural master theory that contains all others as special limits (for reviews see [2]). A candidate for this master theory, the M(atrix) theory, has been recently proposed in [3]. Geometry and/or topology change of spacetime due to dualities is an extensively studied subject. A less well studied facet of this topic is the change of asymptotic geometry due to dualities. Some examples of this type have been studied before in [4, 5]. We shall show in this article using a set of duality transformations and coordinate transformations that one can map supersymmetric configurations of M -branes and D-branes that are asymptotically flat to configurations that are of the type adSk\u00d7E \u00d7S, where adSk is the k-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, E is the l-dimensional Euclidean space and S is the them-dimensional sphere. As we shall see, one can use a specific combination of duality and coordinate transformations that we shall call the shift transformation in order to change the constant part of the harmonic functions appearing in the D and M -brane solutions. These results have a variety of applications. First of all they lead to a better understanding of the issue of supersymmetry enhancement near the horizon of certain black hole configurations. In addition, using our results, we shall be able to relate supergravity computations in the standard space-like compactification of M -theory to finite N M(atrix) theory. Also, our results imply that certain spontaneous compactifications of 10 and 11 dimensional supergravity should exist. In many cases, one can check that such compactifications indeed appear in the supergravity literature. To illustrate the mechanism that converts an asymptotically flat space to an anti-de Sitter space we will start by considering the Dabholkar-Harvey solution of N=1 10d supergravity[6] that describes a fundamental string. We will then generalize this result to a non-extremal string and afterwards to an arbitrary supersymmetric configuration of orthogonally intersecting branes with at least three transverse directions. The metric, antisymmetric tensor and dilaton field of the solution that describes a fundamental string are given by the following expressions ds = H(r)(\u2212dt + dx21) + (dx 2 2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + dx 2 9), B01 = H(r) \u22121 \u2212 1; e = H(r) H(r) = 1 + Q r ; r = x22 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + x 2 9, (1) H is a harmonic function that depends only on the transverse directions. Let us perform a T -duality in the x1 direction. Using Buscher\u2019s rules one obtains ds = (H \u2212 2)dt +Hdx21 + 2(1 \u2212H)dtdx1 + (dx 2 2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + dx 2 9), B = 0; e = 1 (2)", "references": ["Intersections-Involving-Monopoles-and-Waves-in-Bergshoeff-Roo/0b87c59078f13ed9d4c5901308bd3b927b5f9192"]},

It can be thought of as the relative Morse index in cases where the absolute Morse index (the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian) is infinite. The Floer homology groups of such a variational problem arise from a chain complex which is generated by the critical points and graded by the relative Morse index. The boundary operator is given by counting the number of connecting orbits (with appropriate signs) whenever the relative Morse index is 1. This approach to infinite dimensional Morse theory was discovered by Floer in his study of the gradient flow of the symplectic action [11]. In this theory the critical points are fixed points of a symplectomorphism and the connecting orbits are pseudoholomorphic curves in the sense of Gromov.

KAPRANOV"], "date": "1995", "abstract": "The cyclic homology of associative algebras was introduced by Connes [4] and Tsygan [22] in order to extend the classical theory of the Chern character to the non-commutative setting. Recently, there has been increased interest in more general algebraic structures than associative algebras, characterized by the presence of several algebraic operations. Such structures appear, for example, in homotopy theory [18], [3] and topological field theory [9]. In this paper, we extend the formalism of cyclic homology to this more general framework. This extension is only possible under certain conditions which are best explained using the concept of an operad. In this approach to universal algebra, an algebraic structure is described by giving, for each n \u2265 0, the space P(n) of all n-ary expressions which can be formed from the operations in the given algebraic structure, modulo the universally valid identities. Permuting the arguments of the expressions gives an action of the symmetric group Sn on P(n). The sequence P = {P(n)} of these Sn-modules, together with the natural composition structure on them, is the operad describing our class of algebras. In order to define cyclic homology for algebras over an operad P, it is necessary that P is what we call a cyclic operad : this means that the action of Sn on P(n) extends to an action of Sn+1 in a way compatible with compositions (see Section 2). Cyclic operads are a natural generalization of associative algebras with involution (see (2.2)). For associative algebras over a field of characteristic 0, it is a result of Feigin and Tsygan [6] that cyclic homology is the non-abelian derived functor of the functor A 7\u2192 A/[A,A], the target of the universal trace on A. The notion of a trace does not make sense for more general algebras. However, for an associative algebra A with unit, there is a bijection between traces T and invariant bilinear forms B on A, obtained by setting T (x) = B(1, x). It turns out that the structure of a cyclic operad on P is precisely the data needed to speak about invariant bilinear forms on algebras over an operad P. The cyclic homology of an algebra over a cyclic operad P is now defined as the non-abelian derived functor of the target of the universal invariant bilinear form. In making this definition, we were strongly influenced by ideas of M. Kontsevich: he emphasized that invariant bilinear forms are more fundamental than traces [15]. Furthermore, he constructed an action of Sn+1 on the space Lie(n) of n-ary operations on Lie algebras. We construct an explicit complex CA(P, A) calculating the cyclic homology. There is a long exact sequence which involves not only the cyclic homology HA\u2022(P, A) but two other functors HB\u2022(P, A) and HC\u2022(P, A):", "references": ["Batalin-Vilkovisky-Algebras-and-Two-Dimensional-Getzler/55a838d0f47b8f60f6a3b01792cfc0bf87d6d5f9"]},

In this paper we collect evidence that supports this identification. We explicitly identify the perturbative string states and their interactions, and describe the appearance of D-particle and D-membrane states. Introduction By definition, M-theory is the 11-dimensional theory that via compactification on a circle S is equivalent to ten dimensional type IIA string theory [1, 2]. The string coupling constant gs emerges in this correspondence as the radius of the S , while the particles with non-zero KK-momentum along the S are identified with the D-particles of the IIA model. According to the matrix theory proposal put forward in [3], the full dynamics of M-theory can be captured by means of an appropriate large N limit of supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics. In the original correspondence with the type IIA string, the matrix degrees of freedom find their origin in the collective dynamics of the D-particles [4, 5, 6]. The key new ingredient in the approach of [3], however, is that the large N limit effectively accomplishes a decompactification of the extra 11th direction, which therefore should be treated on the exact same footing as all the other uncompactified dimensions. This insight, albeit still conjectural, provides a number of important new theoretical tools. Namely, by interchanging the original role of the 11-th direction with that of one of the other directions, one in principle achieves a concrete identification of the complete non-perturbative particle spectrum of string theory in a given dimension with a relatively convenient subset of states (namely all states that can be made up from infinitely many D-particles) of string theory compactified to one dimension less. In this way, much of the recently developed D-brane technology is upgraded by one dimension and has become directly applicable in the study of M-theory compactifications. In this paper we aim to elaborate this new viewpoint for the simplest compactification of M-theory, namely on S. Following the current approach in matrix theory [3, 7], the compactification on this S is achieved by reinterpreting the infinite dimensional matrices X i as covariant derivatives Di (written in a Fourier mode basis) of a large N gauge field defined on the S. In the original D-particle language, this procedure in fact amounts to applying a T-duality transformation along the S-directions, thereby turning the Dparticles into D-strings. Adopting this approach, we have cast matrix theory into the form of a two-dimensional N = 8 supersymmetric U(N) Yang-Mills theory with the Lagrangian S = 1 2\u03c0 \u222b tr ( (D\u03bcX ) + \u03b8 D/ \u03b8 + g sF 2 \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 1 g2 s [X , X] + 1 gs \u03b8 \u03b3i[X , \u03b8] )", "references": ["Theory-As-A-Matrix-Model-%3A-A-Conjecture-Banks-Fischler/097595e7ba5ad3f8ff81409dd275fc4e1274bec4", "The-Eleven-dimensional-Supermembrane-Revisited-Townsend/c8ec1f3ce7703c245cf852f6546600fb3b679dd6", "D-branes-and-Short-Distances-in-String-Theory-Douglas-Kabat/b4be66cbc4bbc5844b8f9e56f0f6dbd036c22a2c", "IIB-%2F-M-Duality-and-Longitudinal-Membranes-in-M-(-)-Ho-Wu/d39eec1640fb76753ab825b8495fe0f3ed227ebd", "Proposals-on-nonperturbative-superstring-Motl/78f7bacddad9a577e071f7f0ed7f0f9ebc9a96f9", "Rotational-Invariance-in-the-M-(-atrix-)-of-Type-Sethi-Susskind/63d2bcf21aca5cdf2cb61aa8198240b0a10d9636", "Strings-from-Matrices-*-Seiberg/ab32b0334292c9b578c071519fa4cf2b8ae571bb", "BPS-Spectrum-of-the-Five-Brane-and-Black-Hole-Dijkgraaf/06597849cf444cfb182feada1f3fc70e3d2d8286"]},

These algebras appeared recently in the context of string theory, and we give a simple deduction of these algebraic structures from the formal axioms of conformal field theory and string theory. This paper started as an attempt to organize geometrically various algebraic structures discovered in 2d quantum field theory, see Witten and Zwiebach [46], Zwiebach [49], Lian and Zuckerman [29], Getzler [14, 15], Penkava and A. S. Schwarz [32], Horava [20], Getzler and J. D. S. Jones [16], Stasheff [43, 44] and Huang [21]. The physical importance of these structures is that they lead toward the classification of string theories at the tree level, because the structure constants of the algebras appear as all correlators of the theory. We suggest that an appropriate background for putting together those algebraic structures is the structure of an operad. On the one hand, as we point out, a conformal field theory at the tree level is equivalent to an algebra over the operad of Riemann spheres with punctures, cf. Huang and Lepowsky [22]. On the other hand, this one operad gives rise to several other operads creating these various algebraic structures. The relevance to physics is that theories such as conformal field theory or string-field theory provide a representation of the geometry of the moduli space of such punctured Riemann spheres in the category of differential graded vector spaces. This paper, one of a series, deals with a part of these algebraic structures, namely with the structure of a homotopy Lie algebra and the related structures of the gravity algebra and Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra.

From the L\u221e algebra, and the BV equation on the off-shell state space we derive the L\u221e algebra, and the BV equation on physical states that were recently constructed in d = 2 string theory. The string diagrams are surfaces with minimal area metrics, foliated by closed geodesics of length 2\u03c0. These metrics generalize quadratic differentials in that foliation bands can cross. The string vertices are succinctly characterized; they include the surfaces whose foliation bands are all of height smaller than 2\u03c0. \u22c6 Permanent address: Center for Theoretical Physics, MIT, Cambridge, Mass. 02139.

Banks", "Wolfgang Fischler", "Stephen Shenker", "Leonard Susskind"], "date": "1998", "abstract": "We suggest and motivate a precise equivalence between uncompactified eleven dimensional M-theory and the N = \u221e limit of the supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics describing D0 branes. The evidence for the conjecture consists of several correspondences between the two theories. As a consequence of supersymmetry the simple matrix model is rich enough to describe the properties of the entire Fock space of massless well separated particles of the supergravity theory. In one particular kinematic situation the leading large distance interaction of these particles is exactly described by supergravity. The model appears to be a nonperturbative realization of the holographic principle. The membrane states required by M-theory are contained as excitations of the matrix model. The membrane world volume is a noncommutative geometry embedded in a noncommutative spacetime. October 1996 1. Introduction M theory [1] is the strongly coupled limit of type IIA string theory. In the limit of infinite coupling it becomes an eleven dimensional theory in a background infinite flat space. In this paper M-theory will always refer to this decompactified limit. We know very little about this theory except for the following two facts. At low energy and large distances it is described by eleven dimensional supergravity. It is also known to possess membrane degrees of freedom with membrane tension 1 l 3 p where l p is the eleven dimensional Planck length. It seems extremely unlikely that M-theory is any kind of conventional quantum field theory. The degrees of freedom describing the short distance behavior are simply unknown. The purpose of this paper is to put forward conjecture about these degrees of freedom and about the Hamiltonian governing them. The conjecture grew out of a number of disparate facts about M-theory , D branes [2], matrix descriptions of their dynamics [3], supermembranes [4,5,6] and the holographic principle [7]. Simply stated the conjecture is this. M-theory , in the light cone frame, is exactly described by the large N limit of a particular supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics. The system is the same one that has been used previously used to study the small distance behavior of D0 branes [8]. P. Townsend [9] was the first to point out that the supermatrix formulation of membrane theory suggested that membranes could be viewed as composites of D0 branes. Our work is a precise realization of his suggestion. In what follows we will present our conjecture and some evidence for it. \u2026", "references": ["D-branes-from-M-branes-Townsend/a302b47d64e828a1c06216d30d6b5e3a8cee4880", "Dirichlet-Branes-and-Ramond-Ramond-charges.-Polchinski/ac7b9067d1118bfbcd16b767724425e96071f658", "Eleven-Dimensional-Origin-of-String-%2F-String-%3A-a-1-Duff-Liu/7deb368928d3477c33ab9a9a0aefdf5297c5a37d", "Enhanced-Gauge-Symmetries-in-Superstring-Theories-Hull-Townsend/5b4e5e7dca91345150fa5bcfa06a1741f4a42fcf", "Heterotic-%E2%80%93-type-I-superstring-duality-and-actions-Tseytlin/85cb24bfe5902d7e3fc451bca95f1d6d7670e615", "Unity-of-Superstring-Dualities-Townsend/32bb822b32a4859338dbbbd392df228f1eef1494"]},

There is then a natural surjective map \u03ba0 from the equivariant cohomology H \u2217 K(X) of X to the cohomology H(MX). In this paper we prove a formula (Theorem 8.1, the residue formula) for the evaluation on the fundamental class of MX of any \u03b70 \u2208 H (MX) whose degree is the dimension of MX , provided that 0 is a regular value of the moment map \u03bc on X. This formula is given in terms of any class \u03b7 \u2208 H\u2217 K(X) for which \u03ba0(\u03b7) = \u03b70, and involves the restriction of \u03b7 to K-orbits KF of components F \u2282 X of the fixed point set of a chosen maximal torus T \u2282 K. Since \u03ba0 is surjective, in principle the residue formula enables one to determine generators and relations for the cohomology ring H(MX), in terms of generators and relations for H\u2217 K(X). There are two main ingredients in the proof of our formula: one is the localization theorem [3, 7] for equivariant cohomology of manifolds acted on by compact abelian groups, while the other is the equivariant normal form for the symplectic form near the zero locus of the moment map. We also make use of the techniques appearing in our proof of the residue formula to give a new proof of the nonabelian localization formula of Witten ([35], Section 2) for Hamiltonian actions of compact groups K on symplectic manifolds X; this theorem expresses \u03b70[MX ] in terms of certain integrals over X.

Summary of results 0.1. Introduction. In this paper we adress the following three problems. A. Calculate the Betti numbers and Euler characteristics of moduli spaces M 0,n of stable n\u2013pointed curves of genus zero (see e.g. [Ke]), or rather an appropriate generating function for these numbers. B. The same for the space X[n], a natural compactification of the space of n pairwise distinct labelled points on a non\u2013singular compact algebraic variety X constructed for dim X = 1 in [BG] and in general in [FMPh]. (Beilinson and Ginzburg called this space \" Resolution of Diagonals \" , Fulton and MacPherson use the term \" Configuration Spaces \"). C. Calculate the contribution of multiple coverings in the problem of counting rational curves on Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds (see [AM], [Ko], and more detailed explanations below). All these problems are united by the fact that available algebro\u2013geometric information allows us to represent the corresponding numbers as a sum over trees with markings. M. Kontsevich in [Ko] invoked a general formula of perturbation theory in order to reduce the calculation of the relevant generating functions to the problem of finding the critical value of an appropriate formal potential. We solve problems A and B by applying this formalism in a simpler geometric context than that of [Ko]. Problem C is taken from [Ko]; we were able to directly complete Kontsevich's calculation in this case and obtain a simple closed answer. We will now describe our results (0.3\u20140.5) and technique (0.6) in some detail. 0.2. General setup. Let Y be an algebraic variety over C, possibly non\u2013 smooth and non\u2013compact.

It is argued that the \u201cholomorphic anomaly\u201d of Bershadsky, Cecotti, Ooguri, and Vafa gives a fundamental explanation of some of the problems. Moreover, their anomaly equation can be interpreted in terms of a rather peculiar quantum version of background independence: in systems afflicted by the anomaly, background independence does not hold order by order in perturbation theory, but the exact partition function as a function of the coupling constants has a background independent interpretation as a state in an auxiliary quantum Hilbert space. The significance of this auxiliary space is otherwise unknown. \u22c6 Research supported in part by NSF Grant PHY92-45317. 1. Background Independence And The Holomorphic Anomaly Finding the right framework for an intrinsic, background independent formulation of string theory is one of the main problems in the subject, and so far has remained out of reach. Moreover, some highly simplified special cases or analogs of the problem, which look like they might be studied for practice, have also resisted understanding. An important example is the problem of understanding the mirror map in the theory of mirror symmetry. In (2, 2) compactification on a Calabi-Yau threefold X, one encounters two sets of renormalizable Yukawa couplings, involving modes coming from H1,1(X) and H2,1(X). These are closely related to two twisted topological field theories that can be constructed for a given Calabi-Yau target space X \u2013 the A model and the B model. Mirror symmetry is a relation between two Calabi-Yau manifolds X and Y , in which the Yukawa couplings involving H1,1(X) are identified with those that involve H2,1(Y ), and vice-versa. Equivalently, mirror symmetry exchanges the A model of X with the B model of Y , and vice-versa. The moduli space of sigma models with a Calabi-Yau target space is locally a product of two factors. One factor, the moduli space MA of the A model, is (an open set in) H1,1(X, I C/2\u03c0iZZ). The other factor, the moduli space MB of the B model, is the moduli space of complex structures on X. Mirror symmetry therefore implies a natural map between MA(X) and MB(Y ). This seems bizarre because \u2013 being related to the linear space H1,1(X, I C) \u2013 MA has a natural \u201cflat\u201d (or really, affine linear) structure, while MB, the moduli space of complex structures, has no such natural structure. Candelas et. al. [1] tried to overcome this problem by using the \u201cspecial coordinates\u201d on MB. Special coordinates are background dependent. They are defined as follows. Pick a complex structure J0 on X representing a base-point in MB. Let \u03a90 be a three-form on X holomorphic with respect to the complex structure", "references": ["Chern-simons-Gauge-Theory-as-a-String-Theory-Witten/14604933e26cc2007d15cb4ad5b6d2666df43705", "Holomorphic-Anomalies-in-Topological-Field-Theories-Bershadsky-Cecotti/ef8669e62df8bf66ab513b339819a9c9bf584f78", "Mirror-Symmetry-and-Rational-Curves-on-Quintic-a-Morrison/79515feb5254908f00d95fc09b5128cecaa62a68", "Multiple-Mirror-Manifolds-and-Topology-Change-in-Aspinwall-Greene/6a1950a2f8d73a6c8cb2c0f432878e7eda8036a4", "A-New-Supersymmetric-Index-Cecotti-Fendley/12044e752bb21bf911c6315f9757897db2f557be", "String-Field-Theory-%3A-Quantum-Action-and-the-Bv-Zwiebach/740717cb00921409fd60fe75da6d50e5c250eae9", "The-Master-Equation-of-2-D-String-Theory-Verlinde/0dd7cc232bf796db7d31ddda1dc42fe0c73ee7c6"]},

T dualities arise from scalar-vector dualities in the worldvolume of the membrane of M theory. \" Electric-magnetic \" dualities arise from a duality transformation in M theory compactified on a 3-torus, which takes the membrane into a fivebrane wrapped around the 3-torus. The conjecture of the existence of an 11 dimensional M theory has led to a better understanding of many non-perturbative effects in string theory [1,2,3,4]. The fundamental formulation of this theory is not yet known, but many of its properties may be derived just from the fact that its low-energy limit is 11 dimensional supergravity. The type IIA string theory and the heterotic E 8 \u00d7 E 8 string theory are described by compactifying M theory on S 1 [1,2] and S 1 /Z 2 [4], respectively. The other consistent string theories, the type IIB and the SO(32) theories, can be reached from these by T duality transformations, so they can only be straightforwardly described by M theory when they are compactified on a circle [3]. All p-brane states (for p \u2264 6) of these string theories may be identified in M theory by starting with a membrane and a fivebrane in 11 dimensions [1,2,3], and their actions (or at least the field content of their worldvolume theories) may also be derived from the action (field content) of the membrane and the fivebrane [5,6,7]. Classically, the interactions of these p-branes which can be seen in weakly coupled string theory may also be derived from simple interactions of the membranes and fivebranes in 11 dimensions [8]. Since M theory is supposed to unify all string theories, it should be possible to understand the origin of all string theory dualities within M theory. The simplest string theory dualities, the T dualities on a circle, are in some sense trivially incorporated into M theory since they serve as the M theory \" definitions \" of the type IIB and SO(32) string theories. We will discuss in section 2 exactly how the type IIB string action arises from M theory by an appropriate worldvolume duality transformation of the membrane.

TSEYTLIN"], "date": "1996", "abstract": "We discuss properties of special supersymmetric extreme black holes in 4 and 5 dimensions which have regular horizons, non-zero entropy and can be interpreted as compactifications of BPS bound states of p-branes in 10 or 11 dimensions. Recently, black holes in string theory have become a subject of intensive research. It was realised that microscopic properties (e.g. statistical origin of the entropy) of certain composite supersymmetric black holes can be addressed systematically using either conformal field theory description of the NS-NS backgrounds or D-brane representation of U-dual R-R backgrounds (for reviews see [1,2]). Low-energy effective actions of string theories contain the metric and a collection of vector and scalar fields. The corresponding equations have various black hole solutions with several vector and scalar fields being non-trivial. Solutions without residual supersymmetry (like Schwarzschild one) are, in general, deformed by \u03b1 \u2032-corrections, so that their properties are hard to determine exactly. Most of supersymmetric backgrounds have certain types of singularities at the horizon. For example, the metric of purely electric extreme black hole has horizon coinciding with singularity (suggesting that \u03b1 \u2032 corrections should become important there), while purely magnetic extreme black hole has dilaton scalar blowing up at the horizon (so that one cannot a priori ignore string loop corrections). All extreme black holes with singular horizons have vanishing area of the horizon, i.e. zero semiclassical Bekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropy. There are, however, remarkable exceptions: special extreme (BPS saturated) black holes with four independent charges in D = 4 and three independent charges in D = 5 have regular horizons and non-zero BH entropy [3,4]. They have minimal possible amount (N = 1) of residual supersymmetry. The fact that all scalars are regular and approximately constant makes them look 'realistic'. They are thus closest analogues of the standard extreme", "references": []},

The 11-d counterpart of the bound state of NS-NS and R-R type IIB strings wound around a circle is a pure gravitational wave propagating along a generic cycle of 2-torus. The extremal (q 1 , q 2) string with non-vanishing momentum along the circle (or infinitely boosted black string) corresponds in D = 11 to a 2-brane wrapped around 2-torus with momentum flow along the (q 1 , q 2) cycle. Applying duality transformations to the string-string solution we find the type IIA background representing the bound state of 2-brane and 0-brane. Its lift to 11 dimensions is simply a 2-brane finitely boosted in transverse direction. This 11-d solution interpolates between a static 2-brane (zero boost) and a gravitational wave in 11-th dimension (infinite boost). Similar interpretations are given for various bound states involving 5-branes. Relations between transversely boosted M-branes and 1/2 supersymmetric non-threshold bound states 2+0 and 5+0 complement those between M-branes with momentum in longitudinal direction and 1/4 supersymmetric threshold bound states 1+0 and 4+0. In the second part of the paper we establish the correspondence between BPS states of type IIB strings on a circle and oscillating states of a fundamental supermembrane wrapped around 2-torus. We show that the (q 1 , q 2) string spectrum is reproduced by the membrane BPS spectrum, determined using a certain limit. This supports the picture suggested by Schwarz.", "references": []},

The lower-dimensional theories are nevertheless consistent truncations of eleven-dimensional supergravity. Owing to the fact that the generalised reduction commutes neither with U-duality nor with ordinary dimensional reduction, many different massive theories can result. The simplest examples arise when just a single axion has the additional linear coordinate dependence. We find five inequivalent such theories in D = 7, and 71 inequivalent ones in D = 4.

The locus of singular points on a given orbifold is equivalent to a link of Wilson lines. This allows one to reduce any correlation function on orbifolds to a sum of more complicated correlation functions in the simpler theory on manifolds. Chern-Simons theory on manifolds is known to be related to 2D CFT on closed string surfaces; here I show that the theory on orbifolds is related to 2D CFT of unoriented closed and open string models, i.e. to worldsheet orbifold models. In particular, the boundary components of the worldsheet correspond to the components of the singular locus in the 3D orbifold. This correspondence leads to a simple identification of the open string spectra, including their Chan-Paton degeneration, in terms of fusing Wilson lines in the corresponding Chern-Simons theory. The correspondence is studied in detail, and some exactly solvable examples are presented. Some of these examples indicate that it is natural to think of the orbifold group Z2 as a part of the gauge group of the Chern-Simons theory, thus generalizing the standard definition of gauge theories. \u2217 E-mail address: horava@yukawa.uchicago.edu \u22c6 Address after September 1, 1994: Joseph Henry Laboratories, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544.", "references": ["Topological-Gauge-Theories-and-Group-Cohomology-Dijkgraaf-Witten/c5a5fa5585823f28ef4c3f5b3fbb3a72cdece327", "Exact-Solution-of-a-Boundary-Conformal-Field-Theory-Callan-Klebanov/b44c6fd7afc0557a73d2493c57ea16e7ed08f05d", "Conformal-Field-Theory-Approach-to-Quantum-Impurity-Affleck/a8f52c7d2dbada459854f70d124bf8e1961ccb63", "Equivariant-Topological-Sigma-Models-H%C7%92rava/5c8a4698e73eac8885ec6d2061cd95726b4ab5b8"]},

Introduction Duality symmetries [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] play an important role in string theories and it has recently been found that duality symmetries of type\u2013II strings have a number of interesting and unusual features [3]. The aim of this paper is to explore duality symmetries and some of their applications in the context of the type\u2013II string in nine and ten dimensions, and the relation of these to eleven-dimensional supergravity. In particular, we aim to understand the T\u2013duality symmetry of the type\u2013II string in backgrounds with one isometry. This symmetry is of a rather unusual type in that it maps type\u2013IIA backgrounds into type\u2013IIB ones, and vice versa [6, 7]. Moreover, whereas in the heterotic string T\u2013duality for backgrounds with one isometry can be understood as a symmetry of nine-dimensional N = 1 supergravity, no such understanding is possible here: the type\u2013II T\u2013duality does not correspond to any symmetry of the nine-dimensional N = 2 supergravity theory. A discussion of our results has been given recently by one of us [8], and there is some overlap with the results of Witten [9] announced at the same conference. The bosonic string compactified from D + d dimensions to D dimensions on a d\u2013torus T d has an O(d, d) duality symmetry which is broken to the discrete subgroup O(d, d; Z) by non-perturbative sigma-model effects. (Either D + d = 26, or there is an additional hidden sector describing internal degrees of freedom through a CFT with c = 26\u2212D \u2212 d, which is suppressed in the following.) This discrete target-space duality or T\u2013duality group includes the well-known R \u2192 \u03b1\u2032/R\u2013duality for each circle in T , where R is the radius, together with shifts of the antisymmetric tensor gauge field and O(d; Z) rotations of the circles into one another; the latter are particular D+d dimensional diffeomorphisms. The O(d, d; Z) is a discrete gauge group, and configurations related by such a duality transformation are physically equivalent. The O(d, d) group is not a string symmetry, but transforms a consistent string background to a new one. This can be generalized to consider the string on a curved D + d dimensional space with d commuting isometries. For consistency, the background must define a conformally invariant sigma-model which implies that the back-", "references": ["Unity-of-Superstring-Dualities-Townsend/32bb822b32a4859338dbbbd392df228f1eef1494", "On-Target-space-Duality-in-P%E2%80%93branes-Sezgin/a8dfebe3943b040338713d2aa6f7500c68072e35"]},

Wall"], "date": "1969", "abstract": "It was recently observed by Novikov that if two compact oriented 4k-manifolds are glued by a diffeomorphism (reversing orientation) of their boundaries, then the signature of their union is the sum of their signatures. The proof is given in [1, 7.1]; the result has been exploited by J~inich [2] to characterise the signature of closed manifolds. In constructing such manifolds, it is often desirable to consider a more general case of glueing: viz. along a common submanifold, which may itself have boundary Z 4k-2, of the boundaries of the original manifolds. Additivity still holds if Z is empty, or more generally if H2k-l(Z;~x) vanishes, by the same argument as before. However, it does not hold in general. The simplest counterexample is the Hopf bundle (with fibre D E) over S 2, with signature + 1 depending on the choices of sign: this is the union of the induced bundles over the upper and lower hemispheres of S 2, each of which (being contractible) has signature zero. In this paper we investigate the deviation from additivity in the general case, and derive a formula for it. For this, we have first to construct a new invariant. First, we recall a standard result from lattice theory, in the form we will use. Let Vbe an abelian group; A, B, C subgroups (all will be real vector spaces of finite dimension in practice). Consider the additive relation between A and B defined by aRb if 3c~C with a+b+c=O. Its domain is the set of a~A expressible as-(b + c), b eB, c~ C; i.e. it is A n (B + C). Also a R 0 precisely when A cA n C. Since corresponding results hold with A and B interchanged, the relation induces an iso-morphism between An(B+C) and Bn(C+A) AnC Bc~C Moreover, in this isomorphism, the images of A c~ B correspond, and we can factor these out. The result is symmetrical in A, B and C: the correspondence a + b + c = 0 induces isomorphisms between W= An(B+C) Bn(C+A) and Cn(A+B) (AnB)+(Ac~C) ' (BnC)+(BnA) ' (CnA)+(CnB)\"", "references": []},

A prediction of this duality is that the heterotic string is a K3 compactification of the solitonic 11-dimensional fivebrane. It is verified that the worldsheet action of the D=10 heterotic string is indeed obtainable by K3 compactification of the worldvolume action of the 11-dimensional fivebrane, and it is suggested how the worldvolume action of the D=11 supermebrane may be similarly obtained by T 3 compactification of the worldvolume action of a D=10 heterotic fivebrane.

Thurston"], "date": "1979", "abstract": "THE CENTRAL objects of study in this paper are collections {C,, . . . , C,} of g disjoint circles on a closed orientable surface M of genus g, whose complement M-(C, u . . . U C,) is a 2g-punctured sphere. We call an isotopy class of such collections a cut system. Of course, any two cut systems are related by a diffeomorphism of M, by the classification of surfaces. We show that any two cut systems are also joined by a finite sequence of simple moues, in which just one Cj changes at a time, to a circle intersecting it transversely in one point and disjoint from the other Ci\u2019s. Furthermore, we find a short list of relations between sequences of simple moves, sufficient to pass between any two sequences of simple moves joining the same pair of cut systems. From these properties of cut systems it is a routine matter to read off a finite presentation for the mapping class group of M, the group of isotopy classes of orientation preserving self-diffeomorphisms of M. Unfortunately, the presentation so obtained is rather complicated, and stands in need of considerable simplification before much light will be shed on the structure of the mapping class group. Qualitatively, one can at least deduce from the presentation that all relations follow from relations supported in certain subsurfaces of M, finite in number, of genus at most two. This may be compared with the result of Dehn [3] and Lickorish [4] that the mapping class group is generated by diffeomorphisms supported in finitely many annuli. A finite presentation in genus two was obtained by Birman-Hilden[2], completing a program begun by Bergau-Mennicke [l]. For higher genus the existence of finite presentations was shown by McCool[ lo], using more algebraic techniques. For another approach to finite presentations, see [12], and for general background on mapping class groups, see [ 111. Our methods apply also to maximal systems of disjoint, non-contractible, nonisotopic circles on M. This is discussed briefly in an appendix.", "references": []},

This is also referred to as target space duality. (For an extensive review and further references, see [5]).

This structure is considerably richer when there are two parameters than in the various one-parameter models that have been studied hitherto. We describe the intrinsic structure of the point in the (compactification of the) moduli space that corresponds to the large complex structure or classical limit. The instanton expansions are of interest owing to the fact that some of the instantons belong to families with continuous parameters. We compute the Yukawa couplings and their expansions in terms of instantons of genus zero. By making use of recent results of Bershadsky et al. we compute also the instanton numbers for instantons of genus one. For particular values of the parameters the models become birational to certain models with one parameter. The compactification divisor of the moduli space thus contains copies of the moduli spaces of one parameter models. Our discussion proceeds via the particular models IP4 [8] and IP4 [12].

As argued earlier, a collection of many D-strings behaves, at large dilaton values, as a single multiply wound string. We use this result and T-duality transformations to show that a similar phenomenon occurs for effective strings produced by wrapping p-branes on a small (p-1)-dimensional torus, for suitable coupling. To understand the decay of an excited D-string at large dilaton values, we study the decay of an elementary string at small dilaton values. A long string, multiply wound on a circle, with a small excitation energy is found to predominantly decay into another string with the same winding number and an unwound closed string (rather than two wound strings). This decay amplitude agrees, under duality, with the decay amplitude computed using the Born-Infeld action for the D-string. We compute the absorption cross section for the D-brane model studied by Callan and Maldacena. The absorption cross section for the dilaton equals that for the scalars obtained by reduction of the graviton, and both agree with the cross section expected from a classical hole with the same charges.

Schwarz"], "date": "1997", "abstract": "An SL(2,Z) family of string solutions of type IIB supergravity in ten dimensions is constructed. The solutions are labeled by a pair of relatively prime integers, which characterize charges of the three-form field strengths. The string tensions depend on these charges in an SL(2,Z) covariant way. Compactifying on a circle and identifying with eleven-dimensional supergravity compactified on a torus implies that the modulus of the IIB theory should be equated to the modular parameter of the torus. Work supported in part by the U.S. Dept. of Energy under Grant No. DE-FG03-92-ER40701. Among the various conjectured duality symmetries of superstring theories, the proposed SL(2,Z) symmetry of the type IIB superstring theory in ten dimensions is especially interesting [1, 2]. Like the SL(2,Z) S duality of the N = 4 D = 4 heterotic string [3, 4], it relates weak and strong coupling. However, unlike the heterotic example in which the symmetry relates electrically and magnetically charged states of the same gauge field, the IIB duality relates electrically charged states of two different gauge fields. In this respect it is more like a T duality [5]. Combined with ordinary T dualities, the IIB SL(2,Z) duality implies the complete U duality symmetry of toroidally compactified type II strings in dimensions D < 10 [1, 6]. The SL(2,Z) duality of the IIB theory will be explored here by considering string-like (or \u2018one-brane\u2019) solutions of the D = 10 IIB supergravity theory. It will be argued that there is an infinite family of such solutions forming an SL(2,Z) multiplet. (This possibility was hinted at in section 5 of Ref. [7].) Once these string solutions have been constructed, we will consider compactification on a circle and compare the resulting nine-dimensional spectrum with that of eleven-dimensional supergravity compactified on a torus. The conclusion will be that the SL(2,Z) duality group of the IIB theory corresponds precisely to the modular group of the torus. All ten-dimensional supergravity theories contain the following terms in common S0 = 1 2\u03ba2 \u222b dx \u221a\u2212g ( R \u2212 1 2 (\u2202\u03c6) \u2212 1 12 eH ) , (1) whereH is a three-form field strength (H = dB), and \u03c6 is the dilaton. Moreover, in each case, a solution to the classical equations of motion derived from S0 can be regarded as a solution of the complete supergravity theory with all other fields set equal to zero. A macroscopic stringlike solution, which was identified with the heterotic string, was constructed by Dabholkar et al. [8] (This was generalized to p-branes in Ref. [9].) More recently, Dabholkar [10] and Hull [11] noted that, since the type I superstring has the same low-energy effective action as the O(32) heterotic string, and since the zero modes work out suitably, these macroscopic heterotic strings can also be regarded as solutions of the type I theory.

Callan and Maldacena have suggested that despite apparent problems of strong interactions when the number of branes becomes large, the open string degrees of freedom may remain very dilute due to the growth of the horizon area which they claim grows more rapidly than the average number of open strings. Such a picture of a dilute weakly coupled string system conflicts with the picture of a dense string-soup that saturates the bound of one string per planck area. A more careful analysis shows that Callan and Maldacena were not fully consistent in their estimates. In the form that their model was studied it can not be used to extrapolate to large mass without being in conflict with the Hawking Bekenstein entropy formula. A somewhat modified model can reproduce the correct entropy formula.

These are both non\u2013perturbative phenomena from the point of view of Heterotic string theory. Although the orientifold models are a natural setting in which to study these non\u2013perturbative Heterotic string phenomena, it is interesting and instructive to explore how such vacua are realised in Heterotic string theory, M\u2013theory and F\u2013theory, and consider the relations between them.

The existence of such solutions would have a profound effect on the quantum theory of gravitation [2,3]. Since fire Yang-Mills pseudoparticles possess self-dual field strengths, one likely possibility is that gravitational pseudoparticles are characterized by self-dual curvature. In fact it has been pointed out by Hawking [3] that the Taub-NUT metric [4], when appropriately continued to euclidean space-t ime, produces a selfdual curvature and hence is a possible candidate for a gravitational pseudoparticle. He has also given a generalized multi-Taub-NUT metric. However, these metrics do not approach a fiat metric at infinity [5].

In each case the lower dimensional theory is a Maxwell/Einstein supergravity theory. We find evidence for an equivalence, in certain cases, with heterotic string com-pactifications from D=10 to D=5,4,3, on compact manifolds of holonomy SU(2) (K 3 \u00d7S 1), SU(3), and G 2 , respectively. Calabi-Yau manifolds with Hodge numbers h 1,1 = h 1,2 = 19 play a significant role in the proposed equivalences. Supergravity theories exist in all spacetime dimensions D with D \u2264 11. The current wisdom is that, as quantum theories, they must be regarded as effective field theories of superstring theories in some appropriate limit. Since the critical dimension of superstring theories is D = 10, the maximal D = 11 supergravity [1] has fallen into relative obscurity. Recently, however, it has been realized that the S 1 compactified D=11 supergravity can be interpreted as the effective field theory of the strongly coupled type IIA superstring, with the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes being identified with the quantum states associated with the BPS-saturated extreme black holes of the D = 10 IIA supergravity theory [2,3]. It was further argued in [2] that, for any value of the string coupling, the type IIA superstring theory is, in reality, an S 1 compactification of the D=11 supermembrane theory of [4]. The classical supermembrane exists in dimensions D = 11, 7, 5, 4 and (trivially) in D = 3, so in this context it is natural to consider compactifications of D = 11 supergravity to these dimensions. In each case one can then consider a further compactification on S 1 to dimensions D = 6, 4, 3, 2, which (together with D=10) are precisely those for which the classical Green-Schwarz superstring action exists. Since we wish to preserve some supersymmetry, these compactifications require consideration of compact spaces of (real) dimension 4, 6, 7 and 8, with holonomy SU(2), SU(3), G 2 , and Spin(7), respectively [7]. All such spaces are Ricci flat (see [5,6] for a proof in the G 2 and Spin(7) cases) so the lower dimensional field theory will have zero cosmological constant. Flat tori of dimensions 4, 6, 7 and 8 are trivial examples of such manifolds, because the holonomy group \u2026", "references": ["Enhanced-Gauge-Symmetries-in-Superstring-Theories-Hull-Townsend/5b4e5e7dca91345150fa5bcfa06a1741f4a42fcf"]},

In ten spacetime dimensions, this dual theory is a superfivebrane and this gives rise to a string/fivebrane duality conjecture according to which the fivebrane may be regarded as fundamental in its own right, with the strongly coupled string corresponding to the weakly coupled fivebrane and vice-versa. After compactification to four spacetime dimensions, the fivebrane appears as a magnetic monopole or a dual string according as it wraps around five or four of the compactified dimensions. This gives rise to a four-dimensional string/string duality conjecture which subsumes a Montonen-Olive type duality in that the magnetic monopoles of the fundamental string correspond to the electric winding states of the dual string. This leads to a duality of dualities whereby under string/string duality the strong/weak coupling S-duality trades places with the minimum/maximum length T duality.

The ring S is a polynomial ring with one variable for each one-dimensional cone in the fan \u2206 determining X, and S has a natural grading determined by the monoid of effective divisor classes in the Chow group A n\u22121 (X) of X (where n = dim X). Using this graded ring, we will show that X behaves like projective space in many ways. The paper is organized into four sections as follows. In \u00a71, we define the homogeneous coordinate ring S of X and compute its graded pieces in terms of global sections of certain coherent sheaves on X. We also define a monomial ideal B \u2282 S that describes the combinatorial structure of the fan \u2206. In the case of projective space, the ring S is just the usual homogeneous coordinate ring C[x 0 ,. .. , x n ], and the ideal B is the \" irrelevant \" ideal x 0 ,. .. , x n. Projective space P n can be constructed as the quotient (C n+1 \u2212{0})/C *. In \u00a72, we will see that there is a similar construction for any toric variety X. In this case, the algebraic group G = Hom Z (A n\u22121 (X), C *) acts on an affine space C \u2206(1) such that the categorical quotient (C \u2206(1) \u2212 Z)/G exists and is isomorphic to X.

For any toric variety, we will see in \u00a73 that finitely generated graded S modules give rise to a coherent sheaves on X, and when X is simplicial, every coherent sheaf arises in this way. In particular, every closed subscheme of X is determined by a graded ideal of S. We will also study the extent to which this correspondence fails to be is one-to-one.

By constructing multi-centered p-brane solitons, the new super p-branes found recently with various values of a = \u2206 \u2212 2(p + 1)(D \u2212 p \u2212 3)/(D \u2212 2) are seen to be bound states of the fundamental ones with \u2206 = 4. \u2020 Research supported in part by NSF Grant PHY-9411543", "references": ["Extremal-Black-Holes-and-Elementary-String-States-Sen/f9c4e299a3fb8b9e0c6761da6b6fb15b1debd892", "Duality-Symmetries-of-4-D-Heterotic-Strings-Schwarz-Sen/7a3f361b4e869583160b77f300feb6ed53051f2c", "Exact-superpartners-of-N%3D2-supergravity-solitons.-Aichelburg-Embacher/d05f7ab8530f917c6628d3a819ef90e17c997cc4", "BOUND-STATES-OF-STRINGS-AND-p-BRANES-Witten/d11be4409755447f99ccbbf943ef03b2503ab013", "Eleven-Dimensional-Origin-of-String-%2F-String-%3A-a-1-Duff-Liu/7deb368928d3477c33ab9a9a0aefdf5297c5a37d", "Extremal-Black-Holes-as-Bound-States-Rahmfeld/0b2fafb68fd00e09b23e35976a37439450e00470", "Four-Dimensional-String-%2F-String-%2F-String-Triality-Duff-Liu/dbb4419c696191f6be8a172eb9c938650da9bf7f", "Heterotic-and-Type-I-String-Dynamics-from-Eleven-H%C7%92rava/782b9d2376c8720e099b5ba9941e4d3799018786"]},

[COGP], [GP]) that (in some circumstances) if V is a Calabi\u2013Yau threefold then one can relate to V a family W (V) t , t \u2208 C of Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds which are \" mirrors \" of V , such that one has the following relation between their Euler characteristics: \u03c7(V) = \u2212\u03c7(W (V) t). One of the properties of this correspondence should be the following: the coefficients of the expansion of certain integrals attached to W (V) t (so called Yukawa couplings) relative to an appropriately chosen parameter are integers from which one may calculate the numbers r d of rational curves of degree d on a generic Calabi\u2013Yau manifold which is a deformation of V. This was verified in [COGP] and [M1],[M2] in the case when V is the quintic hypersurface in CP 4 for rational curves of a small degree. Other authors ([CL],[S]) have suggested a large list of mirrors of hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces. The purpose of this note is to verify the above predictions for the remaining types of Calabi\u2013Yau complete intersections in complex projective space when d = 1 i.e. the case of lines. A Calabi\u2013Yau threefold W is a Kahler manifold such that dim W = 3, the canonical bundle of W is trivial, and the Hodge numbers satisfy h 1,0 = h 2,0 = 0. Let W t be a family of such manifolds and let \u03c9 t be a family of holomorphic 3-forms on W t (unique up to constant for each t because h 3,0 (W t) = 1).

However by identifying the Z manifold with the Gepner model 1 9 we are able to ascribe a geometrical interpretation to the mirror, \u02dc Z, as a certain seven-dimensional manifold. The mirror manifold\u02dcZ is a representative of a class of generalized Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds, which we describe, that can be realized as manifolds of dimension five and seven.

It can be interpreted as a five-dimensional dyonic solitonic string wound around a compact fifth dimension. The conformal model is regular with the short-distance (\u2018throat\u2019) region equivalent to a WZW theory. At distances larger than the compactification scale the solitonic string reduces to a dyonic static spherically-symmetric black hole of toroidally compactified heterotic string. The new four-dimensional solution is parameterised by five charges, saturates the Bogomol\u2019nyi bound and has nontrivial dilaton-axion field and moduli fields of two-torus. When acted by combined T and S-duality transformations it serves as a generating solution for all the static sphericallysymmetric BPS-saturated configurations of the low-energy heterotic string theory compactified on six-torus. Solutions with regular horizons have the global space-time structure of extreme Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black holes with the non-zero thermodynamic entropy which depends only on conserved (quantised) charge vectors. The independence of the thermodynamic entropy on moduli and axion-dilaton couplings strongly suggests that it should have a microscopic interpretation as counting degeneracy of underlying string configurations. This interpretation is supported by arguments based on the corresponding six-dimensional conformal field theory.

D\u2019Auria at the \u201cWorkshop on Gauge Theories, Applied Supersymmetry and Quantum Gravity\u201d, Imperial College, London, UK, 5 10 July 1996 In recent time attempts to study non perturbative properties of gauge theories [1] and string theories [2, 3] have made an essential use of low energy effective lagrangians incorporating the global and local symmetries of the fundamental theories. In this analysis BPS states play an important role [4, 5], especially in connection with enhancement of gauge symmetries [6, 7, 8] and more generally for phase transitions which may be signaled by some BPS state becoming massless at some point of the underlying moduli space. The BPS states often appear as solitonic solutions of the supergravity field equations in backgrounds preserving some of the supersymmetries depending on the degree of extremality of the solitonic state. Recently a lot of information on black holes and black p-branes in diverse dimensions have been obtained using these methods. For instance, extremal black holes preserving one supersymmetry in D = 4 and 5 dimensions have an entropy formula obtained in a rather moduli independent way by minimizing the ADM mass in the moduli space [9]. The underlying geometry of the moduli space plays a fundamental role in finding these solutions since the ADM mass or, more generally, the mass per unit of p\u2013volume for p\u2013extended objects depends on the asymptotic value of the moduli and some other physical quantities, such as the classical determination of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula, are also related to properties of the moduli space (for a detailed bibliography on these topics see references in [10]). In view of these applications it is interesting to see how far the formalism used to derive the Bekenstein\u2013Hawking entropy formula from extremization of central charges can be extended to higher N supergravities in diverse dimensions [11]. In this lecture we give a short account of the group theoretical formalism which underlies the construction of central and matter charges. For an application to the black hole entropy formula, see ref. [10]. A more extended version of the present paper is given in ref. [12]. First of all we observe that, in view of several non perturbative dualities between different kinds of theories, a given theory is truly specified by the dimension of space\u2013time in which it lives, the number of unbroken supersymmetries and the massless matter content. With the exception of D = 4, N = 1, 2 and D = 5, N = 2 all supergravity theories contain scalar fields whose kinetic Lagrangian is described by", "references": []},

We construct an exact fermionic realization of an N=1 supersymmetric string theory in D=8 with non-simply-laced gauge group Sp(20).

N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is known to be finite in four dimensions [1], and there is growing evidence that the theory exhibits an extension of Olive-Montonen strong-weak coupling duality known as S-duality[2] [3]. A generalization of the Olive-Montonen duality of N=4 theories has also been identified in N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory [4]. In string theory, conjectures for S-duality have mostly been explored in the context of toroidal compactifications of the ten-dimensional heterotic string to spacetime dimensions D<10 [5]. It would be helpful to have insight into the generic moduli space, and the generic duality group, of such maximally supersymmetric string theories. We will therefore consider the possibility of exact solutions to string theory beyond those obtained by dimensional reduction from a ten-dimensional superstring. These solutions are exact in the sigma model (\u03b1) expansion but are perturbative in the string coupling constant. To be specific, we will construct solutions to heterotic string theory, i.e., with (NR, NL)=(2, 0) superconformal invariance on the world-sheet. Our construction is, however, quite general and the conclusions can be adapted to solutions of any closed string theory in any spacetime dimension. Toroidal compactification of the ten-dimensional N=1 heterotic string to six (four) dimensions results in a low-energy effective N=2 (N=4) supergravity coupled to 20 (22) abelian vector multiplets, giving a total of 24 (28) abelian vector gauge fields with gauge group (U(1)) ((U(1))), respectively. Four (six) of these abelian multiplets are contained within theN=2 (N=4) supergravity multiplets. At enhanced symmetry points in the moduli space the abelian group (U(1)) ((U(1))) is enlarged to a simply-laced group of rank 20 (22). The low energy field theory limit of such a solution has maximally extended spacetime supersymmetry. Since all of the elementary scalars appear in the adjoint representation of the gauge group, symmetry breaking via the Higgs mechanism is adequate in describing the moduli space of vacua with a fixed number of abelian multiplets. In this work we show that there exist maximally supersymmetric vacua with four, six, and eight-dimensional Lorentz invariance that are not obtained by toroidal compactification of a ten-dimensional heterotic string. The total number of abelian vector multiplets in the four-dimensional theory can be reduced to just six, namely, those contained within the N=4 supersymmetry algebra. This is consistent with known theorems on the world-sheet realizations of extended spacetime supersymmetry in", "references": ["Reducing-S-duality-to-T-duality.-Harvey-Moore/f3e1f03a9cd7ec691f5e2cf14b3f4b01be796cf0"]},

Unexpected and exciting links are found with two-dimensional rational conformal field theory. One of the most remarkable known quantum field theories in four dimensions is the N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. This theory has the largest possible number of supersymmetries for a four-dimensional theory without gravity. It is believed to be exactly finite and conformally invariant. A long-standing conjecture asserts that this theory has a symmetry exchanging strong and weak coupling and exchanging electric and magnetic fields. This conjecture originated with work of Montonen and Olive, who [1] proposed a symmetry with the above properties and also exchanging the gauge group G with the dual group G (whose weight lattice is the dual of that of G). It was soon realized that this duality was more likely to hold supersymmetrically [2] and in fact the N = 4 theory was seen to be the most likely candidate [3] since only in that case the elementary electrons and monopoles have the same quantum numbers. (It has recently been argued that an analog of Montonen-Olive duality does hold for a certain N = 2 theory with matter hypermultiplets [4].) While Montonen-Olive duality was originally proposed as a Z 2 symmetry involving the coupling constant only, the N = 4 theory has one more parameter that should be included, namely the \u03b8 angle. As was originally recognized in lattice models [5,6] and string theory [7,8], when the \u03b8 angle is included, it is natural to combine it with the gauge coupling constant g in a complex parameter \u03c4 = \u03b8 2\u03c0 + 4\u03c0i g 2. Then the Z 2 originally proposed by Olive and Montonen can be extended to a full SL(2, Z) symmetry acting on \u03c4 in the familiar fashion \u03c4 \u2192 a\u03c4 + b c\u03c4 + d ; (1.2) here a, b, c, and d are integers with ad \u2212 bc = 1, so that the matrix a b c d (1.3) has determinant 1. Indeed, SL(2, Z) is generated by the transformations S = 0 1 \u22121 0 (1.4) 1 and T = 1 1 0 1.

It is hoped that this will provide a model for possible generalizations to Floer theory. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classi\u00aecation: 57R70, 57Q10; 37C27, 57R58. In two papers with Yi-Jen Lee [HL1, HL2], we de\u00aened a notion of Reidemeister torsion for the Morse theory of closed 1-forms on a \u00aenite dimensional manifold. We consider the  \u0304ow dual to the 1-form via an auxiliary metric. Our invariant, which we call I, multiplies the algebraic Reidemeister torsion of the Novikov complex, which counts  \u0304ow lines between critical points, by a zeta function which counts closed orbits of the  \u0304ow. For a closed 1-form in a real multiple of an integral cohomology class, i.e. d of a circle-valued function, we proved in the above papers that I equals a form of topological Reidemeister torsion due to Turaev. This implies a posteriori that I is invariant under homotopy of the circle-valued function and the auxiliary metric. In this paper we reprove these results using an opposite approach: we \u00aerst prove a priori that I is a topological invariant, depending only on the cohomology class of the closed 1-form. We then deduce that I agrees with Turaev torsion, by using invariance to reduce to the easier case of an exact 1-form. This approach has two advantages. First, it works for closed 1-forms in an arbitrary cohomology class, thus extending the results of our previous papers. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the proof of invariance here should provide a model for the possible construction of torsion in Floer theory. The contents of this paper are as follows. In \u00a71 we review the de\u00aenition of the invariant I, state the main results, and outline the proofs. In \u00a72 and \u00a73 we prove that I is invariant. The strategy is to study how I varies in a generic one parameter family of 1-forms and metrics. In \u00a72, we prepare for this analysis by classifying the bifurcations that generically occur, and we also deal with the complication that in\u00aenitely many bifurcations may occur in a \u00aenite time. The heart of the paper is in \u00a73, where we analyze what happens in each individual bifurcation. While the torsion of the Novikov complex and the zeta function can change, we will see that their product I does not. In \u00a74 we use topological invariance to give a quick proof that I agrees with Turaev torsion. In \u00a75 we discuss open questions and possible generalizations.

This paper will study the moduli theory of such pairs. However, it is by no means a routine generalization of the well-known theory of stable bundles. Rather, it will discuss at least three remarkable features of the moduli spaces of pairs: 1. Unlike bundles on curves, pairs admit many possible stability conditions. In fact, stability of a pair depends on an auxiliary parameter \u03c3 analogous to the weights of a parabolic bundle. This parameter was first detected by Bradlow-Daskalopoulos [6] in the study of vortices on Riemann surfaces, and indeed the spaces we shall construct can also be interpreted as moduli spaces of rank 2 vortices. As \u03c3 varies, we will see that the moduli space undergoes a sequence of flips in the sense of Mori theory, whose locations can be specified quite precisely. 2. For some values of \u03c3 the moduli space M(\u03c3, \u039b) is the blow-up of PH 1 (\u039b \u22121) along X , embedded as a complete linear system. Thus we can use M(\u03c3, \u039b) to study the projective embeddings of X. In particular, we obtain a very general formula (7.8) for the dimension of the space of hypersurfaces of degree m + n in PH 1 (\u039b \u22121) with a singularity at X of order n \u2212 1. This formula does not depend on the precise choice of X and \u039b, only on g and d, which is rather surprising. 3. For other values of \u03c3 , stability of the pair implies semistability of the bundle, so M(\u03c3, \u039b) plays the role in rank 2 Brill-Noether theory of the symmetric product in the usual case, and there is an Abel-Jacobi map from M(\u03c3, \u039b) to the moduli space of semistable bundles. For large d this is generically a fibration, so we can use moduli spaces of pairs to study moduli spaces of bundles. In particular, we recover the known formulas for Poincar\u00e9 polynomials [2, 14] and Picard groups [9]; more spectacularly, we prove, and generalize, the rank 2 Verlinde formula (7.10) for both odd and even degrees.

We conjecture that this is a certain orbifold involving the maximal torus of G. Yang-Mills S-duality makes predictions for all correlators of this effective conformal field theory. These predictions are shown to be implied by the standard T -duality of the conformal field theory. Consequently, Montonen-Olive duality between electric and magnetic states reduces to the standard two-dimensional duality between momentum and winding states. Jan. 8, 1995; Revised Feb. 23, 1995 Seventeen years ago Montonen and Olive [1] made a bold conjecture: Yang-Mills theory with gauge group G and coupling constant e is identical to a gauge theory based on the dual gauge group G 1 [2] with coupling 4\u03c0/e. The identification involves a relabeling of states and operators, interchanging particles with solitons, and electric charges with magnetic charges. It was quickly realized [3,4] that the conjecture is viable only for N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills. When a \u03b8 angle is included, 2\u03c0 shifts of \u03b8 together with the ZZ2 symmetry of Montonen and Olive generate an SL(2, ZZ) symmetry which acts on the complex coupling constant \u03c4 \u2261 \u03b8 2\u03c0 + 4\u03c0 e2 i \u2261 \u03b8 2\u03c0 + i \u03b1 (1) as \u03c4 \u2192 a\u03c4 + b c\u03c4 + d , (2) with ad \u2212 bc = 1, a, b, c, d \u2208 ZZ. This SL(2, ZZ) symmetry on the space of theories is known as S-duality. S-duality originated in the study of lattice models [5,6] but has come to play a prominent role in recent speculations concerning the structure of both N = 4 Yang-Mills theory and string theory [7] as reviewed in [8]. Initial evidence in favor of S-duality for N = 4 Yang-Mills was provided by the exact agreement [3,4] of the (calculable) masses of the stable elementary particles and solitons with those predicted by the ZZ2 symmetry of Montonen and Olive. More recently the masses of some bound states have been demonstrated to be in agreement with the full S-duality [8], and the predictions of S-duality for a topologically twisted version of the theory on a more general four-manifold have been tested [9] . A skeptic could remain unconvinced by this evidence. It concerns only zeromomentum, supersymmetric or topological properties of the theory. Such properties are highly constrained by the powerful symmetries of theory, especially by the N = 4 supersymmetry. Thus, a true skeptic may argue that the evidence to date all follows from the known symmetries of the theory in some delicate way. A more reasonable skeptic might argue that S-duality is indeed non-trivial, but only holds for the supersymmetric or BPS saturated states of the theory. If the Montonen-Olive conjecture is correct, the theory and its S-dual must agree on much more than this. In particular, all finite-momentum correlation functions must agree. This is clearly not implied by the known symmetries: the addition of higher dimension operators to the theory can change the correlation functions without affecting the topological quantities. It is also clear that a two-particle state 1 We recall the definition of G below. 1 with non-zero center of mass momentum is not BPS saturated even if the individual oneparticle states are. Thus evidence for S-duality at non-zero momentum necessarily involves evidence for S-duality away from the supersymmetric subspace of the theory. In this paper, we will propose and confirm \u2013 with some assumptions \u2013 a finitemomentum test of S-duality, albeit in a very special limit. The idea is to compactify four-dimensional N = 4 Yang-Mills with group G to two dimensions on a torus. At distances large compared to the size of the torus, the effective theory must reduce to a conformal field theory. We conjecture and give plausibility arguments that this takes a particular form involving the maximal torus T \u2282 G (and some antisymmetric tensor fields if \u03b8 is nonzero). S-duality transformations involve no dimensionful parameters, and therefore commute with scale transformations. S-duality of D = 4, N = 4 Yang-Mills therefore makes a definite prediction of an exact duality symmetry of the effective conformal field theory which must act on all finite-momentum correlation functions. This prediction will indeed be confirmed in the following: S-duality reduces to the well-known \u201cT -duality\u201d of conformal field theory in which tori are interchanged with their duals. The interchange of electric and magnetic charges effected by S-duality is essentially the familiar interchange of momentum and winding modes effected by T -duality. Consider compactification of D = 4, N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with compact gauge group G. For simplicity we first consider only the case for which the simply connected covering group G\u0303 associated to G is SU(n). The general case is treated in the appendix.

Research supported in part by NSF Grant PHY-9411543. 1 Classical/Quantum Duality There is now a consensus that the really important questions of string theory will never be answered within the framework of a weak coupling perturbation expansion. Here I describe some recent work which begins to address this strong coupling problem. It is based on the idea that the same physics may equally well be described by the fundamental four-dimensional superstring or by a dual four-dimensional superstring [1] that corresponds to a soliton solution of the fundamental string. In this respect, the idea provides a stringy generalization of the old Montonen-Olive conjecture [3] of a duality between the electrically charged particles of a fundamental supersymmetric theory and its magnetically charged solitons. Indeed, the latter duality is in fact subsumed by the former in that the solitonic magnetic H-monopoles [4, 5] of the fundamental string are the fundamental electric winding states of the dual string [6, 7]. This four-dimensional string/string duality is a corollary of the tendimensional string/fivebrane duality which states that the same physics may equally well be described by the fundamental ten-dimensional superstring (an extended object with one spatial dimension) or by a dual ten-dimensional superfivebrane [8] (an extended object with five spatial dimensions) that corresponds to a soliton solution of the fundamental string [9, 10]. The pay-off, if such a conjecture proves to be true, is that the strongly coupled string corresponds to the weakly coupled fivebrane. After compactification to four dimensions, the fivebrane will appear as an H-monopole or a dual string according as it wraps around 5 or 4 of the compactified dimensions [9] which, for concreteness and simplicity, we take to be a six-dimensional torus. The inverse tension of the dual string, 2\u03c0\u03b1\u0303, is related to that of the fundamental string, 2\u03c0\u03b1, by the Dirac quantization rule [1] 8GR = n\u03b1\u2032\u03b1\u0303\u2032 n = integer (1) where G is Newton\u2019s constant and R is the compactification scale. One\u2019s first guess might therefore be to assume that the strongly coupled fourThis dual string of [1] is not to be confused with the stringy cosmic string of [2]. The two solutions are different. It could in principle also appear as a membrane by wrapping around 3 of the compactified dimensions, but the fundamental four-dimensional string obtained in this way does not admit the membrane soliton [1].", "references": []},

K3 compactification of the latter then yields the familiar gauge and Lorentz Chern-Simons corrections to 3-form Bianchi identities of the heterotic string. We note that the absence of a dilaton in the D = 11 theory allows us to fix both the gravitational constant and the fivebrane tension in terms of the membrane tension. We also comment on an apparent conflict between fundamental and solitonic heterotic strings and on the puzzle of a fivebrane origin of S-duality.

In the present paper we study the twisted Lefschetz function \u03b6L(\u2212v), where \u03c9 is a Morse form, and v is a C generic \u03c9-gradient. This \u03b6-function is defined with respect to the abelian covering M\u0302 \u2192M with the structure group H1(M). We prove that \u03b6L(\u2212v) equals to the torsion of a chain homotopy equivalence between Novikov Complex and the completed cellular chain complex of this covering of the manifold, and that this \u03b6-function belongs to the corresponding localization of the group ring of H1(M). The relations with Seiberg-Witten invariants of 3-manifolds are discussed. Introduction and the statement of the result We recall first some notions of Morse-Novikov theory. Let G be a group, \u03be : G\u2192 R be a homomorphism. Denote by \u039b the group ring Z[G] and by \u039b\u2212\u03be the Novikov completion of the group ring, that is the ring of all the power series \u03bb = \u2211 g ngg, such that for every C the set \u03be ( [C,\u221e] ) \u2229 supp \u03bb is finite. Denote by U\u03be the group of trivial units in the group of invertible elements of \u039b\u2212\u03be , i.e. U\u03be = {\u03bb \u2208 \u039b | \u03bb = \u00b1g +R, where g \u2208 G, supp R \u2208 \u03be \u22121 ( ]\u2212\u221e, \u03be(g)[ ) }. We shall denote the image of this group in K1(\u039b \u2212 \u03be ) by U c \u03be . Denote finally K1(\u039b \u2212 \u03be )/U c \u03be by Wh(G, \u03be). A chain homotopy equivalence between two free based chain complexes over \u039b\u2212\u03be will be called simple, if its torsion vanishes in Wh(G, \u03be). Now let M be a closed connected manifold, and \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(M) be a Morse form. We shall call \u03c9 rational Morse form, resp. integral Morse form, if the deRham cohomology class [\u03c9] belongs to the image of H(M,Q), resp. of H(M,Z). An integral Morse form will be called primitive if deRham cohomology class is the image of an indivisible integral cohomology class. Let P : M\u0302 \u2192 M be a regular covering of M with the structure group G, such that P(\u03c9) is cohomologous to 0. Denote by Gt(\u03c9) the set of all \u03c9-gradients satisfying the transversality assumption, and let v \u2208 Gt(\u03c9). For every zero x of \u03c9 choose a lifting of x to M\u0302 and an orientation of the stable manifold of x. To this data one associates a free based chain complex over \u039b\u2212\u03be (where \u03be : \u03c01(M) \u2192 R is the period map of the form \u03c9) called Novikov complex. (See e.g. [10] for precise definition in the case of rational Morse forms, i.e. for the forms with [\u03c9] \u2208 H(M,Q) .)

Parameters of this deformation are coordinates on the space H * (V), and the structure constants are the third derivatives of a formal series \u03a6 V (potential, or free energy) whose coefficients count the number of parametrized rational curves on V with appropriate incidence conditions (see [KM] for details). A natural problem arises how to calculate \u03a6 V \u00d7W in terms of \u03a6 V and \u03a6 W. In [KM] it was suggested that this operation corresponds to that of tensor multiplication of Cohomological Field Theories, or equivalently, algebras over the moduli operad {H * (M 0,n+1)}. The definition of the tensor product depends on a theorem on the structure of H * (M 0,n+1) whose proof was only sketched in [KM] (Theorem 7.3). One of the main goals of this note is to present this proof and related calculations in full detail. (For another proof, see [G]).

In a sense, we almost solved both problems. There are still certain gaps in the foundations. Nevertheless, we obtain \u201cclosed\u201d formulas for generating functions in the topological sigma-model for a wide class of manifolds, covering many CalabiYau and Fano varieties. We reduced Mirror Symmetry in a basic example to a certain complicated but explicit identity. We have made several computer checks. All results were as expected. In particular, we computed the \u201cphysical\u201d number of rational curves of degree 4 on a quintic 3-fold (during 5 minutes on Sun), which was out of reach of previous algebro-geometric methods. The text consists of 5 parts. The first part contains the definition of stable maps used through all the paper. We establish several basic properties of moduli spaces of stable maps. Also, we give an outline of a construction of Gromov-Witten invariants for all algebraic projective or closed symplectic manifolds. For the reader who is interested mainly in computations it is enough to look through 1.1 and to the statements of theorems occuring in 1.3.1-1.3.2. In section 2 we describe a few examples of counting problems in the enumerative geometry of curves. One of the examples is rational curves on quintics. We give a simple algebro-geometric definition for the number of curves without assuming the validity of the Clemens conjecture or using symplectic methods. The main body of computations is contained in section 3. Our strategy here is quite standard: we reduce our problems to questions concerning Chern classes on a space of rational curves lying in projective spaces (A. Altman S. Kleiman, S. Katz), and then use Bott\u2019s residue formula for the action of the group of diagonal matrices (G. Ellingsrud and S. A. Str\u00f8mme). As a result we get in all our examples certain sums over trees. In section 4 we develop a general scheme for summation over trees. By Feynman rules we know that such a sum should be equal to the critical value of some functional. Using a trick we obtain an equivalent functional which is a quadratic polynomial in infinitely many variables with coefficients depending on a finite number of variables. Thus, all our counting problems are reduced to the inversion of certain explicit square matrices with coefficients of hypergeometric kind.

We prove that for a given Morse form \u03c9 and a C 0 generic \u03c9-gradient these incidence coefficients are rational functions. The incidence coefficients in the Novikov complex are obtained by counting the algebraic number of the trajectories of the gradient, joining the zeros of the Morse form.

The most compelling argument in its favour is that it naturally describes an ultraviolet finite and unitary perturbative quantum gravity 1. That this is true only in a spacetime of ten dimensions (D=10) is not so much a problem as an invitation to find a realistic model of particle physics by compactification to D=4 2.

Klebanov"], "date": "1992", "abstract": "I study the Ward identities of the w\u221e symmetry of the two-dimensional string theory. It is found that, not just an isolated vertex operator, but also a number of vertex operators colliding at a point can produce local charge non-conservation. The structure of all such contact terms is determined. As an application, I calculate all the non-vanishing bulk tachyon amplitudes directly through the Ward identities for a Virasoro subalgebra of the w\u221e. Recently, a considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the role of discrete states in two-dimensional string theory. In the context of the c = 1 matrix model they were first noticed in refs. [1, 2], while in the continuum approach they have been known for a long time [3]. These physical states, that are present only for quantized values of momentum, are the remnants of transverse string excitations [4]. They appear, somewhat surprisingly, in the two-dimensional string model and make it quite non-trivial. In a number of recent papers it was shown that the discrete states generate large symmetry groups, such as the area preserving diffeomorphisms. In the matrix model this was done in ref. [5-8], while in the continuum \u2013 in ref. [9, 10]. A better understanding of these symmetries may hold the key to a complete solution of the theory. In this paper I derive the symmetry Ward identities and show how they determine the non-vanishing \u201ctachyon\u201d correlation functions. I will restrict myself to the non-compact closed string case and to the \u201cbulk\u201d correlation functions that satisfy the energy sum rule [4, 11]. The symmetry currents were constructed by Witten [9] who first understood the important physical role of the BRST invariant discrete states of ghost number zero [12]. The currents assume the form [9] WJ,m = \u03a8J+1,m(z)\u014cJ,m(z\u0304) W\u0304J,m = \u03a8\u0304J+1,m(z\u0304)OJ,m(z) (1) where J = 0, 2 , 1, . . ., and m = \u2212J,\u2212J + 1, . . . , J \u2212 1, J . The fields \u03a8j,m are the gravitationally dressed primary fields of the c = 1 matter system, \u03a8j,m(z) = \u03c8j,m(z)e (z) (2) The chiral algebra of these fields was calculated in ref. [9], and somewhat more explicitly in ref. [10]. We will normalize fields so that \u03a8j1,m1(z)\u03a8j2,m2(0) = 1 z 2(j1m2 \u2212 j2m1)\u03a8j1+j2\u22121,m1+m2(0) . (3) The crucial point in the construction of the currents is the existence of the BRST", "references": []},

Thorbergsson"], "date": "1996", "abstract": "The classical local invariants of a submanifold in a space form are the first fundamental form, the shape operators and the induced normal connection, and they determine the submanifold up to ambient isometry. One of the main topics in differential geometry is to study the relation between the local invariants and the global geometry and topology of submanifolds. Many remarkable results have been developed for submanifolds in space forms whose local invariants satisfy certain natural conditions. The study of focal points of a submanifold in an arbitrary Riemannian manifold arises from the Morse theory of the energy functional on the space of paths in the Riemannian manifold joining a fixed point to the submanifold. The Morse index theorem relates the geometry of a submanifold to the topology of this path space. The focal structure is intimately related to the local invariants of the submanifold. In the case of space forms one can go backwards and reconstruct the local invariants from the focal structure, so it is not too surprising that most of the structure theory of submanifolds can be reformulated in terms of their focal structure. What is perhaps surprising is a fact that became increasingly evident to the authors from their individual and joint research over the past decade: while extending the theory of submanifolds to ambient spaces more general than space-forms proves quite difficult if one tries to use the same approach as for the space forms, at least for symmetric spaces it has proved possible to develop an elegant theory based on focal structure that reduces to the classical theory in the case of space forms. This paper is an extended report on this theory, and the authors believe that the methods developed herein provide important tools for a continuing study of the submanifold geometry in symmetric spaces. First we set up some notations. Let (N, g) be a Riemannian manifold, M an immersed submanifold of N , and \u03bd(M) the normal bundle of M . The end point map \u03b7 : \u03bd(M)\u2192 N of M is the restriction of the exponential map exp to \u03bd(M). If v \u2208 \u03bd(M)x is a singular point of \u03b7 and the dimension of the kernel of d\u03b7v is m, then v is called a multiplicity m focal normal and exp(v) is called a multiplicity m focal point of M with respect to M in N . The focal data, \u0393(M), is defined to be the set of all pairs (v, m) such that v is a multiplicity m focal normal of M . The focal variety V(M) is the set of all pairs (\u03b7(v), m) with (v, m) \u2208 \u0393(M). The main purpose of our paper is to study the global geometry and topology", "references": []},

Consequently, this comparison provides a more sensitive test of the effective string picture of the D-brane bound state than does the cross-section for ordinary scalars.

Introduction Whereas classical massless field theories are often conformally invariant, the same is rarely true of their quantum counterparts. To define a quantum field theory, you need to specify both a Lagrangian and a cutoff. The cutoff introduces a hidden dimensional scale in the definition of the theory. A scale transformation relates a quantum theory with a given cutoff to another quantum theory with the scaled cutoff. Therefore a QFT with nontrivial cutoff dependence (i.e., nonzero beta function) is never scale invariant, and so never conformally invariant. Since quantum field theories generically have nonzero beta function, a study of the implications of exact conformal invariance on a quantum field theory might seem to be of limited interest. That is, however, not the case. A QFT is indeed not scale invariant at arbitrary cut off, but as you lower the cut off in your theory, a truly gapless theory flows, in the Wilsonian sense, to a fixed point of the renormalization group-i.e., a point with zero beta function. Long wavelength physics in such a theory is thus governed by an effective quantum theory that is exactly scale invariant. In many examples this effective quantum field theory is a free massless theory. In some cases of interest however, the low energy effective theory is an interacting scale invariant, and generically conformally invariant [1] quantum field theory. Low energy effective theories completely specify the vacuum structure of a theory, and the nature of its massless excitations, and hence are of interest. Supersymmetric field theories have proved to be particularly amenable to exact analysis in the infrared. Interacting gapless theories with unbroken supersymmetry typically exhibit both conformal and supersymmetric invariance in the infrared. The full symmetry of the (low energy effective) theory must then be generated by a superalgebra that contains in it, as sub super algebras, both the conformal algebra and the supersymmetry algebra. Such algebras are very constrained-in fact none exist in d \u22656, and their possible forms are known in d \u2264 6. These algebras are called superconformal algebras, and the symmetry they generate is called superconformal symmetry. Three examples of interacting superconformal theories of current interest are the intrinsic theories living on the world volumes of coincident M 2 , M 5 , D 3 \u2026", "references": []},

This new theory appears to be a new kind of a non-critical string theory. Clearly, these two descriptions differ from the \" standard \" Super-Yang-Mills In the last few months a significant amount of evidence has accumulated in support of the conjecture of Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind on the non-perturbative formulation of M-theory [1]. The structure of 11-dimensional supergravity and the membrane of M-theory were found in [1]. The longitudinal 5-brane was found in [2-4]. Various D-branes were constructed in [4]. Elementary strings and part of their interactions were constructed in [5-8]. The interactions of solitonic states also seem to fit the expected pattern from M-theory [9]. In [1-4,6,10-14] compactifications on tori were considered. It was suggested that M theory on T d is defined by d + 1 dimensional super-Yang-Mills (SYM) on\u02c6T d wher\u00ea T d is a torus dual to the space-time torus. However, for d > 3 these field theories are not renor-malizable, and therefore cannot give a complete description of the theory. Furthermore, one cannot define them as the long distance limit of another theory in d + 1 dimensions with the same amount of supersymmetry. For such a description to exist, there must be a fixed point of the renormalization group in d + 1 dimensions with that supersymmetry. However, such fixed points do not exist [15]. It is possible that these theories can be defined by a fixed point with fewer supersym-metries. Another approach, which we will pursue here, is to define the 4+1 dimensional theory not by a 4+1 dimensional fixed point but by a 5+1 dimensional fixed point with (2,0) supersymmetry [16,17]. This leads to a geometric understanding of the U-duality group [17,14]. It is important to stress that the 5+1 dimensional description does not follow from the 4+1 dimensional gauge theory. It is a definition of the latter.

Besides the related dual symmetry in superstrings theory (for a recent review and references see ref 1), the notion of duality appears in supersymmetric Yang-Mills and topological theories [2-6]. There is also a renewed interest in the study of the analogous to electric-magnetic duality in conventional Yang-Mills theory [7-11]. The purpose of this letter is to study, within the geometrical language that the Loop Representation (L.R.) provides [12-15], the topological content underlying the \u201celectro-magnetic\u201d duality that ordinary Abelian gauge theories present. As we shall see, when these theories are quantized in a generalized L.R. that explicitly incorporates the dual symmetry, the canonical Poisson algebra results translated into a non-local algebra of geometric dependent operators. This algebra is topological, in the sense that it is not affected by continuous deformations of the spatial manifold. To begin, let us consider free Maxwell theory in 3+1 dimensions. We shall work in flat space time, with g\u03bc\u03bd = diag(+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212). Maxwell equations \u2202F\u03bc\u03bd = 0 (1.a) \u2202 \u2217F\u03bc\u03bd = 0 (1.b) where \u2217F\u03bc\u03bd = 1 2 \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1F , are invariant under \u21c0 E\u2192 \u2212 \u21c0 B, \u21c0 B\u2192 \u21c0 E (i.e.: F \u2192 F ).

This led to Hofer\u2019s discovery of symplectic capacities, which give a way of measuring the size of subsets in symplectic manifolds. Recently, Hofer found a way to measure the size (or energy) of symplectic diffeomorphisms by looking at the total variation of their generating Hamiltonians. This gives rise to a bi-invariant (pseudo-)norm on the group Ham(M) of compactly supported Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms of the manifold M . The deep fact is that this pseudo-norm is a norm; in other words, the only symplectomorphism on M with zero energy is the identity map. Up to now, this had been proved only for sufficiently nice symplectic manifolds, and by rather complicated analytic arguments. In this paper we consider a more geometric version of this energy, which was first considered by Eliashberg and Hofer in connection with their study of the extent to which the interior of a region in a symplectic manifold determines its boundary. We prove, by a simple geometric argument, that both versions of energy give rise to genuine norms on all symplectic manifolds.

We construct both K\u00e4hler and non-K\u00e4hler examples, and show independence of the conditions that these two cohomology classes vanish on spherical homology. In particular, we show that the symplectic form can pair trivially with all spherical classes even when the Chern class pairs nontrivially. Floer's original approach to the Arnol'd Conjecture [F] worked for closed symplectic manifolds (X, \u03c9) satisfying the additional hypotheses that [\u03c9] and c 1 (\u03c9) in H 2 (X; R) should vanish on all spherical homology classes. While more recent work has avoided these hypotheses in this particular context, elsewhere the question has persisted of which symplectic manifolds satisfy the above hypotheses. Clearly the hypotheses are true for aspherical manifolds, but there are apparently no other published examples for which [\u03c9] vanishes on all spherical classes, prompting various people to ask whether such \" symplectically aspherical \" manifolds are always aspherical. In this note, we answer the question in the negative. (The author has been informed that J. Kollar and P. Seidel have also reached this conclusion, although the details of their solutions are apparently different.) To be more precise, let \u03a0(X) = span R (Im(\u03c0 2 (X) \u2192 H 2 (X; R))) denote the subspace of H 2 (X; R) spanned by spherical classes. We construct families of closed, symplectic 4-manifolds (X, \u03c9) for which \u03a0(X) has arbitrarily large dimension, but both \u03c9 and c 1 (\u03c9) vanish on \u03a0(X). We produce such a family for which each \u03c9 is a K\u00e4hler form, and a different family for which no X is homotopy equivalent to a K\u00e4hler manifold. We also show that the conditions that \u03c9 and c 1 (\u03c9) vanish on \u03a0(X) are independent \u2014 in particular, we can have \u03c9|\u03a0(X) = 0 but c 1 (\u03c9)|\u03a0(X) = 0. Note that since \u03a0(X) = H 2 (X; R) when X is simply connected, any closed symplectic manifold with \u03c9|\u03a0(X) = 0 must have infinite fundamental group. The question of which topologies (e.g. fundamental groups) are realized by symplectically aspherical manifolds seems highly nontrivial. Our construction is based on symplectic branched coverings. It is well-known that symplectic structures can be lifted under branched coverings with symplectic branch loci. The following lemma \u2026", "references": []},

Our methods are different from the development in [Tanaka, 79] or [Baston, 91], in particular they are simpler, more explicit and transparent. We also compute explicite formulae for the canonical Cartan connections in terms of the underlying distinguished linear connections. In the first part of this series, [\u010cap, Slov\u00e1k, Sou\u010dek], we defined almost Hermitian symmetric structures as \u2018second order structures\u2019. Now, we will first show that any first order structure with the \u2018right\u2019 structure group gives rise to an almost Hermitian symmetric structure in this sense. Basically, the construction is just the standard first prolongation of G\u2013structures, see [Kobayashi] or [Sternberg]. Due to the special situation, there is a canonical prolongation which admits the structure of a principal bundle with the structure group B. Moreover, it turns out that for all almost Hermitian structures, there exists a unique normal Cartan connection. We shall present the explicit construction in section 2. Thus, the calculus developed in Part I of this series will yield natural operators in all these cases. Furthermore, we compute explicitly the corresponding deformation tensors \u0393 in the last section. Our results extend those by [Ochiai, 70], but his methods using the vanishing torsion assumption restrict in fact the considerations to the locally flat structures in many cases, cf. [Baston, 91] or [\u010cap, Slov\u00e1k, 95]. Tanaka\u2019s general development certainly covers our existence result, however his approach and aims are so far different from ours, that we believe to need much more space to refer to [Tanaka, 79] than to present our simple independent proof. Another approach to the construction of the canonical Cartan connections on certain auxiliary vector bundles, thus avoiding the construction of the prolongation, can be found in [Baston, 91]. In the sequel, we shall use the notation and results from Part I of this series of papers, the citations like I.2.3 mean the corresponding items in that part. 1. The prolongation of first order structures 1.1. Let us recall the setting we work in from the first part of this series of papers: We start from a connected semisimple real Lie group G whose Lie algebra g is equipped with a grading g = g\u22121\u2295 g0\u2295 g1. By B we denote the closed (parabolic) This work was mostly done during the stay of the authors at the Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger Institute in Vienna.

Then it is known that (1) g0 is reductive with one\u2013dimensional center (2) the map g0 \u2192 gl(g\u22121) induced by the adjoint representation is the inclusion of a subalgebra and an irreducible representation (3) the Killing form identifies g1 as a g0 module with the dual of g\u22121. (4) the restrictions of the exponential map to g1 and g\u22121 are diffeomorphisms onto the corresponding closed subgroups of G. (5) B0 \u2229B1 = {e} (6) B is the semidirect product of B0 and B1, see [Ochiai, Sections 3 and 6]. Examples of such Lie algebras and the corresponding structures can be found in I.3.3. In particular recall that there are the classical projective structures, which occur in this picture as the extremal case of an almost Grassmannian structure. The projective structures behave rather exceptionally and we will have to treat them separately. 1.2. Our starting point is a first order B0\u2013structure on a smooth manifold M of dimension m = dim(g\u22121), so assume that we have given a principal B0 bundle P0 \u2192 M together with a soldering form \u03b8\u22121 \u2208 \u03a9(P0, g\u22121) which is strictly horizontal, i.e. its kernel in each tangent space is precisely the vertical tangent space, and B0 equivariant, so (r b)\u2217\u03b8\u22121 = Ad(b\u22121) \u25e6 \u03b8\u22121. This is equivalent to P0 being a reduction of the (first order) frame bundle P M of M , cf. I.3.6. Now consider the tangent bundle TP0, the vertical subbundle V P0 and the quotient bundle TP0/V P0. The fundamental vector field map gives a trivialization V P0 ' P0 \u00d7 g0, while the soldering form induces a trivialization TP0/V P0 ' P0 \u00d7 g\u22121. For a point u \u2208 P0 consider a linear isomorphism \u03c6 : g\u22121 \u2295 g0 \u2192 TuP0 which is compatible with the two trivializations from above, i.e. such that \u03c6(0, A) = \u03b6A(u) and \u03b8\u22121(u)(\u03c6(X,A)) = X. Via \u03c6 the exterior derivative d\u03b8\u22121(u) gives rise to a mapping g\u22121 \u2227 g\u22121 \u2192 g\u22121, defined by (X,Y ) 7\u2192 d\u03b8\u22121(u)(\u03c6(X, 0), \u03c6(Y, 0)), and we view this mapping as t\u03c6 \u2208 g\u22121 \u2227 g\u22121 \u2297 g\u22121, and call it the torsion of \u03c6. Now let \u03c6\u0304 be another isomorphism compatible with the trivializations. Then there is a linear map \u03c8 : g\u22121 \u2192 g0 such that \u03c6\u0304(X,A)\u2212\u03c6(X,A) = \u03b6\u03c8(X)(u). The difference between the corresponding maps constructed using d\u03b8\u22121(u) can be easily computed: Lemma. In this situation we have: d\u03b8\u22121(u)(\u03c6\u0304(X, 0), \u03c6\u0304(Y, 0))\u2212 d\u03b8\u22121(u)(\u03c6(X, 0), \u03c6(Y, 0)) = \u2212[\u03c8(X), Y ] + [\u03c8(Y ), X]. Proof. Using bilinearity of d\u03b8\u22121(u) and the fact the \u03c6\u0304(X,A) = \u03c6(X,A) + \u03b6\u03c8(X)(u) the difference can be expressed as d\u03b8\u22121(u)(\u03b6\u03c8(X), \u03c6(Y, 0)) + d\u03b8\u22121(u)(\u03c6(X, 0), \u03b6\u03c8(Y )) + d\u03b8\u22121(u)(\u03b6\u03c8(X), \u03b6\u03c8(Y )). Since \u03b8\u22121 is horizontal and the Lie bracket of vertical vector fields is vertical, the last term vanishes. On the other hand, the infinitesimal version of the B0\u2013equivariancy of \u03b8\u22121 is clearly L\u03b6A\u03b8\u22121 = \u2212ad(A) \u25e6 \u03b8\u22121, and again by horizontality this reduces to i\u03b6Ad\u03b8\u22121 = \u2212ad(A)\u25e6\u03b8\u22121. Applying this we see that the first term from above reduces to \u2212[\u03c8(X), \u03b8\u22121(\u03c6(Y, 0))] = \u2212[\u03c8(X), Y ] and similarly for the second term. \u00a4 II. NORMAL CARTAN CONNECTIONS 3 There is a canonical map \u2202 from L(g\u22121, g0) ' g\u22121 \u2297 g0 to g\u22121 \u2227 g\u22121 \u2297 g\u22121, the composition of the alternation in the first two factors with the map induced by the inclusion g0 \u2192 g\u22121 \u2297 g\u22121 obtained from 1.1.(2). Using this map, the lemma above just says that d\u03b8\u22121(u)(\u03c6\u0304(X, 0), \u03c6\u0304(Y, 0))\u2212 d\u03b8\u22121(u)(\u03c6(X, 0), \u03c6(Y, 0)) = \u2212\u2202(\u03c8)(X,Y ). Thus the above construction gives rise to a well defined function P0 \u2192 (g\u22121 \u2227 g\u22121 \u2297 g\u22121)/\u2202(g\u22121 \u2297 g0), called the structure function of the B0\u2013structure. 1.3. The map \u2202 : g\u22121 \u2297 g0 \u2192 g\u22121 \u2227 g\u22121 \u2297 g\u22121 from above is the differential in the Spencer cohomology, the cohomology of the abelian Lie algebra g\u22121 with values in the representation g. It is a crucial fact for the computation of this cohomology that there is an adjoint \u2202\u2217 : g\u22121 \u2227 g\u22121 \u2297 g\u22121 \u2192 g\u22121 \u2297 g0, defined by (\u2202\u2217\u03c6)(X) = \u2211 i[Z , \u03c6(Xi, X)], where {Xi} is a basis of g\u22121 and Z is the dual basis of g1, see 1.1.(3). It turns out that there is an inner product on g such that \u2202\u2217 is the adjoint of \u2202, see [Ochiai, Proposition 4.2]. Thus the kernel Ker(\u2202\u2217) is a complementary subspace to the image of \u2202. Note that all spaces occurring in the above considerations are in fact g0\u2013modules. It is easy to verify that both \u2202 and \u2202\u2217 are in fact homomorphisms of g0\u2013modules. In particular, this implies that Ker(\u2202\u2217) is even a complementary g0\u2013module to the image of \u2202. This will be crucial in the sequel. 1.4. Now we define P to be the set of all linear isomorphisms \u03c6 : g\u22121\u2295 g0 \u2192 TuP0 as in 1.2 such that \u2202\u2217(t\u03c6) = 0. It is easy to see that for each u \u2208 P0 such \u03c6 actually exist as follows: Take any \u03c6 satisfying the conditions of 1.2. Then, as Ker(\u2202\u2217) is complementary to Im(\u2202), there is a linear map \u03c8 \u2208 g\u22121 \u2297 g0 such that \u2202\u2217 ( d\u03b8\u22121(u)(\u03c6(X, 0), \u03c6(Y, 0)) + (\u2202\u03c8)(X,Y ) ) = 0. (In fact the image of \u03c8 under \u2202 is uniquely determined.) Then one immediately verifies that \u03c6\u0304(X,A) := \u03c6(X,A) + \u03b6\u03c8(X)(u) satisfies the condition. Next take an element b \u2208 B. Viewing b as an element of G we have the adjoint action Ad(b) : g\u2192 g, and since Ad(exp(Z))\u00b7X = X + [Z,X] + 1/2[Z, [Z,X]] + . . . (cf. I.3.8), we see that g1 is stable under this adjoint action, so we get an induced linear automorphism Ad(b) of the space g/g1 ' g\u22121 \u2295 g0. For b \u2208 B denote by b0 the class of b in B/B1 ' B0. Then for an element \u03c6 : g\u22121\u2295g0 \u2192 TuP0 of P we define \u03c6\u00b7b : g\u22121\u2295g0 \u2192 Tu\u00b7b0P0 by \u03c6\u00b7b := Tr0 \u25e6\u03c6\u25e6Ad(b), where r0 denotes the principal right action of b0 on P0. 1.5. Proposition. This defines a free right action of B on P . In each case except the one of projective structures this action is also transitive on each fiber of the obvious projection P \u2192M . Proof. Let us first verify that \u03c6\u00b7b is again in P . So we have to compute d\u03b8\u22121(u\u00b7b0)((\u03c6\u00b7b)(X, 0), (\u03c6\u00b7b)(Y, 0)), for elements X,Y \u2208 g\u22121. By B0\u2013equivariancy of \u03b8\u22121 this equals Ad(b\u22121 0 )(d\u03b8\u22121(u)(\u03c6(Ad(b)\u00b7(X, 0)), \u03c6(Ad(b)\u00b7(Y, 0)))). 4 ANDREAS \u010cAP, JAN SLOV\u00c1K, VLADIM\u0131\u0301R SOU\u010cEK Now we may write b = b0b1 for some b1 \u2208 B1 and by 1.1.(4) there is a Z \u2208 g1 such that b1 = exp(Z). Using the formula for the adjoint action of an exponential from above we see that Ad(b)\u00b7(X, 0) = Ad(b0)\u00b7Ad(exp(Z))(X, 0) = (Ad(b0)\u00b7X,Ad(b0)\u00b7[Z,X]), and thus \u03c6(Ad(b)\u00b7(X, 0)) = \u03c6(Ad(b0)\u00b7X, 0) + \u03b6Ad(b0)\u00b7[Z,X](u). The same computation as in the proof of lemma 1.2 then shows that d\u03b8\u22121(u)(\u03c6(Ad(b)\u00b7(X, 0)), \u03c6(Ad(b)\u00b7(Y, 0))) = = d\u03b8\u22121(u)(\u03c6(Ad(b0)\u00b7X, 0), \u03c6(Ad(b0)\u00b7Y, 0))+ Ad(b0)\u00b7([[Z,X], Y ]\u2212 [[Z, Y ], X]) = d\u03b8\u22121(u)(\u03c6(Ad(b0)\u00b7X, 0), \u03c6(Ad(b0)\u00b7Y, 0)). This shows that t\u03c6\u00b7b = b0\u00b7t\u03c6, so \u2202\u2217(t\u03c6\u00b7b) = b0\u00b7\u2202\u2217(t\u03c6) = 0, and hence \u03c6\u00b7b \u2208 P . Next, let us assume that \u03c6\u00b7b = \u03c6 for some \u03c6 \u2208 P and b \u2208 B. Then obviously b \u2208 B1, since B0 acts freely on P0. So as before we may write b = exp(Z). But then \u03c6\u00b7b = \u03c6 implies that [Z,X] = 0 for all X \u2208 g\u22121, which implies Z = 0 by 1.1.(3). Finally, to prove transitivity of the action it suffices to show that B1 acts transitive on each fiber of P \u2192 P0, since B0 acts transitive on each fiber of P0 \u2192M . But for two maps \u03c6, \u03c6\u0304 in the same fiber we see from 1.2 that \u03c6\u0304(X,A) = \u03c6(X,A) + \u03b6\u03c8(X)(u) for some \u03c8 \u2208 g\u22121\u2297 g0, and lemma 1.2 shows that if both maps are in P we must have \u2202(\u03c8) = 0. But now in all cases except the projective one the corresponding Spencer cohomology group H(g) is trivial, so there is a Z \u2208 g1 such that \u03c8 = adZ , see [", "references": ["Differential-geometry-of-Cartan-connections-Alekseevsky-Michor/169e95efd7c955891be1518af7dd572ecc1aedf1"]},

In particular we rely on the work of Shifman and Vainshtein relating the \u03b2-function of the gauge coupling to the anomalous dimensions of the matter fields. Finite N=1 models, which have marginal operators at zero coupling, are easily identified using our approach. The method can also be employed to find manifolds of fixed points which do not include the free theory; these are seen in certain models with product gauge groups and in many non-renormalizable effective theories. For a number of our models, S-duality may have interesting implications. Using the fact that relevant perturbations often cause one manifold of fixed points to flow to another, we propose a specific mechanism through which the N=1 duality discovered by Seiberg could be associated with the duality of finite N=2 models.", "references": []},

Even before coupling to gravity, the topological torus has an infinite number of point-like physical observables, which give rise via the BRST descent equations to an infinite symmetry algebra of the model. The point-like observables of ghost number zero form a topological ground ring, whose generators span a spacetime manifold; the symmetry algebra represents all (ground ring valued) diffeomorphisms of the spacetime. At nonzero ghost numbers, the topological ground ring is extended to a superring, the spacetime manifold becomes a supermanifold, and the symmetry algebra preserves a symplectic form on it. In a decompactified limit of cylindrical target topology, we find a nilpotent charge which behaves like a spacetime topological BRST operator.

The lectures outline the development, in the last decade of Lie\u2019s program for multiplicatively closed subsets of Lie groups. These are called semigroups and were already considered by Sophus Lie himself. He had not much more use for them than demonstrating through their simplest examples that the existence of an identity element and inverses would not follow from the assumptions he made to define what he called a group [5]. Today we have several fields of mathematical research in which they occur naturally. As an example we name the areas of (i) nonlinear control (Sussmann theory of controllability on manifolds), (ii) manifolds with a partial order (causality, chronogeometry, geometry), and (iii) representation theory of Lie groups (Ol\u2019shansk\u012d\u0131 theory). In the meantime we are interested here in explaining as many aspects as possible on the foundations of a Lie theory of semigroups: How far do Sophus Lie\u2019s ideas carry us in this direction? What are the characteristic problems left open at this time?

We introduce an explicit procedure to generate natural operators on manifolds with almost Hermitian symmetric structures and work out several examples of this procedure in the case of almost Grassmannian structures. This paper splits into two parts. In the rst part, we introduce a procedure to generate invariant operators on manifolds with almost Hermitian symmetric (AHS) structures. This procedure is inspired by the Jantzen{Zuckermann translation principle in representation theory and by curved versions of this principle. A curved translation principle was rst applied in Eastwood{Rice] to four{ dimensional conformal geometry, versions for conformal manifolds of arbitrary dimensions and for other structures can be found in Eastwood] and in Bailey{ Eastwood{Gover]. It should be remarked that there is another approach which leads to powerful curved versions of the translation principle in the conformal case (see Baston] and Eastwood{Slovv ak]) which probably are better suited to prove general existence results than the procedure presented here. The advantage of the latter is the bigger generality, that it immediately leads to explicit formulae for the operators in question, and that it also leads to starting points for translations. In the second part of the paper, we apply the translation procedure in several simple instances in the case of almost Grassmannian structures, arriving at several examples of invariant operators of low order in this case. Thanks to the notion of jet prolongations of representations developed in CSS1], these are mainly purely algebraic computations. The nal results of these computations can then easily be translated into the language of diierential operators. Our reference for the general theory of AHS{structures is CSS1].

A two\u2013fold puzzle appears in the extremal case, e.g. k1 = k2 +k3. First, the supergravity calculation involves analytic continuation in the ki variables to define the product of a vanishing bulk coupling and an infinite integral over AdS. Second, extremal correlators are uniquely sensitive to mixing of the single\u2013trace operators trXk with protected multi-trace operators in the same representation of SU(4). We show that the calculation of extremal correlators from supergravity is subject to the same subtley of regularization known for 2-point functions, and we present a careful method which justifies the analytic continuation and shows that supergravity fields couple to single traces without admixture.

Smilga"], "date": "1997", "abstract": "We present a detailed analysis of the domain walls in supersymmetric gluodynamics and SQCD. We use the (corrected) Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective Lagrangians to explicitely obtain the wall profiles and check recent results of Ref. [1]: (i) the BPS-saturated nature of the walls; (ii) the exact expressions for the wall energy density which depend only on global features of dynamics (the existence of a non-trivial central extension of N = 1 superalgebra in the theories which admit wall-like solutions). If supersymmetry is softly broken by the gluino mass, the degeneracy of the distinct vacua is gone, and one can consider the decay rate of the \u201cfalse\u201d vacuum into the genuine one. We do this calculation in the limit of the small gluino mass. Finally, we comment on the controversy regarding the existence of N distinct chirally asymmetric vacua in SU(N) SUSY gluodynamics.", "references": []},
